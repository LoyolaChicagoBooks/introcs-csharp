<p>We intend this book as an introduction to computer science, with a focus on
creating problem solutions in the C# programming language.
We should not jump in too quickly.  You can get lost in our details and
miss an idea of the much larger breadth of computer science.</p>
<section id="information-processing">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>Information Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#information-processing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Computer Science is the study and practice of information processing.
This can take many forms.  Many forms appear in electronic computers,
but information processing takes place in many other contexts, too:</p>
<p>In the early days of electronic computers,
the information was largely numerical, calculating mathematical functions.</p>
<p>Later analyzing textual information
has become much more important, for instance:
What can you tell about the severity of the current flu outbreak by
analyzing the phrasing in Google searches?</p>
<p>Images are analyzed:  What can a satellite image tell you about the
distribution of drought?</p>
<p>Sounds:  how do you convert verbal speech accurately
into written sentences?</p>
<p>DNA holds information that our bodies process into proteins.</p>
<p>Our brain chemicals and
electronic signals process information.  There is  rich interplay
between cognitive scientists and computer scientists modeling
problem solving in the brain with <em>neural nets</em> on a computer,
sometimes to better understand brains and
sometimes to
better solve problems on an electronic computer.</p>
<p>Economic systems are becoming better understood in terms of the
flow of information.</p>
<p>The <em>computer</em> doing computations and processing can be a familiar <em>electronic</em>
computer, but it can be genes or brain chemicals,
or a whole society as its economy adapts.</p>
</section>
<section id="algorithms">
<span id="index-2"></span><h2>Algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithms" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Algorithms are at the heart of traditional problem solving .  An <em>algorithm</em>
is a clearly expressed sequence of steps leading to a result in a
finite amount of time.</p>
<p>A recipe for baking a pound cake is an algorithm.</p>
<p>Such an algorithm has useful concepts that we use later in computer
programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A named sub-problem: your recipe may include the instruction
“Beat 4 eggs.”  The recipe probably says no more about it, but this is
<em>shorthand</em>, a name for a simpler sequence of steps, an
algorithm like:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Beating Any Number of Eggs
---------------------------
1. Get a bowl large enough for the eggs.
2. For each egg:
   a. Crack its shell on the edge of the bowl.
   b. Add the contents of the shell to the bowl.
3. Mix the eggs with a whisk.
4. Continue with step 3 until you cannot
   distinguish the white and yolks.
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Parameters: The egg beating instructions work, in general, for any number
of eggs.  To use these instructions for a <em>particular</em> pound cake,
you must supply a specific value to use to make the general instructions
become clear.  The pound cake recipe that uses
the egg beating instructions, uses the number <strong>4</strong> as the actual data.</p></li>
<li><p>Repetition: The instructions for cracking an egg are not <em>written</em> repeatedly,
for every egg.  The instruction is stated once, and we are told how
long to go on: for each egg in step 2.  Step 4 says
when to stop repeating step 3.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="data-representation">
<span id="index-3"></span><span id="id1"></span><h2>Data Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-representation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>A recipe represents data by words that get processed by a human reader.
Machines have used different representations.  One of the earliest
adding machines, the Pascaline,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_calculator">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal’s_calculator</a>,
represented numbers by the angle of
rotation of interlocked gears.
An abacus uses the positions of groups of sliding beads to represent digits.
The Jacquard loom,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_weaving">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_weaving</a>,
used cards with each row of holes punched in them
indicating which warp threads are raised and which lowered when a cross
thread is woven in.</p>
<p id="index-4">In modern electronic computers the most basic bit of data
(actually called a <em>bit</em>) is held by two-state switches, often
in the form of a higher voltage vs. a grounded state.  The symbolic representation
is often 0 vs. 1.  This symbolism comes from the representation of integers
in <em>binary notation</em>, also called <em>base 2</em>:
It is a place value system, but where each place
in a numeral is a 0 or a 1 and represents a power of two, so 1101 in binary
can be viewed in our decimal system as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1)2^3+(1)2^2+(0)2^1+(1)2^0=8+4+0+1=13\)</span>.</p>
<p>Computer hardware can only handle a limited number of bits at a time,
and memory space is limited, so usually integers are stored in a limited
space, like 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits.
We illustrate with the smallest, 8 bits, called a <em>byte</em>.  Since
each bit has two possible states, 8 bits have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^8=256\)</span> possible states.
Directly considered as binary numerals, they represent 0 through
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^8-1=255\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also want to represent negative numbers, and have about half of the available
codes for them.  An 8-bit signed integer in <em>twos complement</em> notation
represents 0 through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^7-1\)</span>
just as the unsigned numbers do.  These are all the 8-bit codes with a leading 0.
A negative number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> in the range <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-2^7=-128\)</span> through -1,
is represented by what would be
the unsigned notation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n+2^8\)</span>.  These will be all the
8-bit codes with a leading 1.
For example -3 is represented like unsigned 256 - 3 = 253: 11111101 in binary.</p>
<p id="index-5">Limited precision approximation of real numbers are stored in something like
scientific notation, except in binary,  roughly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm(m)2^e\)</span>,
with a sign, mantissa m and exponent e. Both e and m have
fixed numbers of bits, so the limited options for the
mantissa restricts the <em>precision</em> of the numbers, and the limited options
for the exponent restricts the <em>range</em>. Data on these limits for
different sized numeric codes is in <a class="reference internal" href="../data/types-and-conversions.html#value-types"><span class="std std-ref">Value Types and Conversions</span></a>.</p>
<p>Once you have numbers, all sorts of other kinds of data can be encoded:
Characters
like on your keyboard each have a numerical code associated with each one.  For
example the unicode for the letter A is 65.  Images are often
represented as a sequence of colored pixels.  Since the human eye is only
sensitive to three specific colors, red, green, and blue,
a pixel is represented by a numerical intensity
for each of the three colors.</p>
</section>
<section id="instruction-representation">
<span id="index-6"></span><h2>Instruction Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#instruction-representation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Besides the data, instructions need a representation too, and an agent to
interpret them.  In the earliest electronic computers the two-state switches
were relays or later vacuum tubes, and the machine was <em>manually rewired</em> when a
new set of instructions/program was needed.  It was a great advance in the 1940’s
when the instructions also became symbolic,
represented by binary codes that the computer
could recognize and act on,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture</a>.
This code is called <em>machine language</em>.
With machine language the instructions became a form of data that could be stored
in computer memory.  We distinguish the <em>hardware</em> on which programs are run
from the stored programs, the <em>software</em>.  The <em>architecture</em> of the
hardware determines the form and capacities of the machine language, so
machines with a different hardware architecture are likely to have distinct
machine languages.</p>
<p>Biologists have a fair idea of how protein sequence data is encoded in DNA,
but they are still working on how the DNA instructions are encoded
controlling which proteins should be made when.</p>
<p>In this book we will not be writing instructions shown as
sequences of 0’s and 1’s!
Some of the earliest programs were to help programmers
work with more human-friendly tools, and an early one
was an <em>assembler</em>, a program that took easier to understand instructions
and automatically translated them into machine language.  An example
assembler instruction would be like</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>MOV 13, X
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to move the value 13 to a storage location identified by the name X.</p>
<p>Machine instructions are very elementary, so programming
was still tedious, and code could not be reused on a
machine with a different architecture.</p>
<p>The next big step past assembler was the advent of
<em>high level</em> languages, with instructions more like normal mathematical or
English expressions.  Examples are Fortran (1954) and Cobol (1959).
A Fortran statement for calculating a slope like</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>S=(Y-V)/(X-U)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>might require seven or or more machine code instructions.</p>
<p>To use a Fortran program required three steps: write it (onto punch cards
originally), compile it to machine code, and execute the machine code.
The compiler would still be architecture specific, but the compiler for
an architecture would only need to be written once, and then any number of
programs could be compiled and run.</p>
<p>A later variant for executing a high-level language is
an <em>interpreter</em>.  An interpreter translates the high-level language
into machine code, and immediately executes it, not storing the
machine code for later
use, so every time a statement in the code is executed again,
the translation needs to be redone.  Interpreters are also
machine-specific.</p>
<p>Some later languages like Java and C# use a hybrid approach: A compiler,
that can run on any machine, does most of the work by
translating the high-level language program
into a low-level <em>virtual machine</em>
language called a <em>bytecode</em>.  This is not the machine language for any real machine,
but the bytecode is simple
enough that writing an interpreter for it is very easy.
Again the interpreter for the bytecode must be machine-specific.
In this approach:</p>
<p>Program source =&gt; COMPILER =&gt; bytecode =&gt; INTERPRETER =&gt; execution</p>

<span id="index-7"></span><h2>Program Development Cycle<a class="headerlink" href="#program-development-cycle" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to check your understanding of small new pieces of C# is to write
a highly specified small program that will be sure to test the new ideas.
That is totally unlike the real world of programming.  Here is a more realistic
sequence:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Clients have a problem that they want solved.</p></li>
<li><p>They connect with software developers.</p></li>
<li><p>The clients discuss the needs of their users.</p></li>
<li><p>The software developers work with them to make sure they
understand the desired deliverables, and work through the
design decisions and their tradeoffs.</p></li>
<li><p>Software developers start building and testing and showing off the
core pieces of the software, and build on out.</p></li>
<li><p>The clients may not have a full idea of what they want and the
software developers may not have a full idea of what is feasible, and
seeing the latest version leads both sides to have a clearer vision.
Then the previous process steps are repeated, iteratively refining
the product.</p></li>
<li><p>After a production version is out, there may be later versions and error
fixes, again cycling back to the earlier steps.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that very important parts of this process are not centered on coding,
but on communicating clearly with a possibly non-technical client.
Communication skills are critical.</p>

<span id="index-8"></span><h2>Key Computer Science Areas<a class="headerlink" href="#key-computer-science-areas" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Most of the introduction so far has been about key concepts that underlie
basic programming. Most of the parts so far about electronic computers
could have been written decades ago.  Much has emerged since then,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the Internet</p></li>
<li><p>the development of economical multi-processor machines
distributing computation into many parallel parts</p></li>
<li><p>the massive explosion of the amount of information to be stored
from diverse parts of life</p></li>
<li><p>the coming <em>Internet of things</em>, where sensors are coming to all
sorts of previously “dumb” parts of the world, that now can be tracked
by GPS and reacted to in real time.</p></li>
<li><p>Computers are now embedded in all sorts of devices:  toasters, thermostats,….
Automobiles of today have more computing power embedded in various devices
than early mainframe computers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We conclude with a brief discussion of some of the other organizing
principles of
computer science.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Communication</dt><dd><p>As the world is criss-crossed with media transmitting gigabytes of
data per second, how do we keep the communication reliable and secure?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Coordination</dt><dd><p>With multiple networked entities, how do we
enhance cooperation, so more work is done in parallel?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Recollection</dt><dd><p>As the amount of data stored skyrockets, how do we effectively store
and efficiently retrieve information?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Evaluation</dt><dd><p>How do we predict the performance and plan the necessary capacity
for computer systems?  The most spectacular recent public failure
in this area was the rollout of the federal Affordable Care
website.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Design</dt><dd><p>How do we design better/faster/cheaper/reliable hardware and software systems?
What new programming languages will be more expressive, lead to fewer
time-consuming errors, or be useful in proving that a major program never
makes a mistake?  Errors in programs controlling machines delivering
radiation for cancer treatment have had errors and led to patient death.</p>
<p>Hardware changes can be evolutionary or revolutionary:
Instead of electric circuits can we use light, quantum particles, DNA…?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Computation and Automation</dt><dd><p>What can we compute and automate?  Some useful
sounding problems have been proven to be unsolvable.  What are the limits?</p>
</dd>
