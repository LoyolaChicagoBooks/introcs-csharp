NAnt and Run Scripts
=======================

In a previous lab, we covered the basics of compiling and running programs 
using the Mono Compiler. For the most part, the programs we do in an introductory 
computer science class are simple. 
They comprise a single source file as opposed to the more common real-world 
case of *multiple* source files. Even so, for our course, we provide a number of 
utilities--a term that comes from infrastructure that we rely upon, 
such as electricity, natural gas, etc.--that help you to do various tasks that are 
somewhat tedious in the C# language. One example of this is the UI (user interface) 
class that helps you to read in various type of input, including numerical and text.

To make it possible to use our code while writing your own, we introduce NAnt, 
which is an automatic compilation system for .Net programs. 
NAnt is a program that accepts a *build* file as its input and uses this file to 
figure out how to compile your program. The *build* file is written in a 
language called XML (Extensible Markup Language), which is similar to the HTML 
language that you use to create web documents. 
The key difference between HTML and XML is the ability to create user-defined tags. 
For more information about this
language, see http://markuplanguages.courses.thiruvathukal.com.

To get you started with one-file programs in your examples folder, 
*you do not need to know anything about NAnt at all*, as long as you use
a run script from the next section.

.. index:: build scripts
   run script
   
.. _build-scripts:

Convenience Scripts
----------------------------------

We have separate Windows and OSX/Linux scripts to simplify common tasks for the
single-file programs directly in the examples folder: our examples or ones you add.  
Windows scripts end in ".cmd",
and the Mac/Linux scripts end in ".sh".  The Mac/Linux scripts should be  
called by starting the line with "sh ".  You can also use a run script in other 
places discussed below.  

In all cases *the program(s) you are working on should be in the current directory*. 
For the initial discussion, that mean the current directory 
should be our examples directory, from the archive you should have downloaded.

Changing your current directory was introduced in the first :ref:`lab-edit-compile-run`,
and discussed in greater depth in the appendix :ref:`commandline`. 

Example commands using the scripts are given for Windows and then Mac/Linux.

The main script to use is the run script:

- run (a particular program).  
  Do not include the ".cs" from the program file name.  
  
  It compiles, *only if necessary*.  If there are compile errors, it lists
  them and stops.  If the code is legal, the .exe file is run in debug mode so
  runtime errors are better located.  Command line parameters for
  your program may also be added at the end of the line, as in the
  ``print_param`` examples below.
  
  .. code-block:: none

     run.cmd birthday1
     sh run.sh birthday1
    
     run.cmd print_param first second third
     sh run.sh print_param first second third
    
  The run scripts are set up to automatically find and include
  any code needed from our :ref:`library-classes`, in particular ``UIF`` and ``UI``.
  Using the mcs command and these libraries requires extra verbiage that we are avoiding
  by using a run script.  So once you start using the library classes, 
  *do use the run script*.
  
  For a program that *you* are working on, the basic cycle should be to 
  
  * edit (for instance with :ref:`jedit`) and save a version
  * switch to the console window and use the run script line to test
  
  and repeat, fixing errors until you have thoroughly tested your program.
    
There are also other scripts that you might find useful at some point:

- buildall (useful to initially build all the given single-file examples so you
  can later execute them directly, without waiting to compile). The tradeoff is that
  this initial step for *all* the files takes a while!

  .. code-block:: none

     buildall.cmd
     sh buildall.sh

- build (a particular program).  This compiles, if necessary, but does not run.
  Do not include the ".cs" at the end of the program file name:

  .. code-block:: none

      build.cmd birthday1
      sh build.sh birthday1
    
  This functionality is included the run scripts, so you only need to use this
  script if there is some reason why you do *not* wan the program run at the time.
    
- clean (remove all build products for a program):

  .. code-block:: none

     clean.cmd birthday1
     sh clean.sh birthday1
  
  The folder can get cluttered up with all the products of compiling.  This removes
  all the results of compiling one program.
  
This is all you need for single-file programs.  

.. index::  work folder

.. _work-folder:

A Folder For Your Work
----------------------

If you want to add all your single-file programs to the examples folder,
you can compile and run them just like the given examples, with the appropriate
run script.  If you would like your work separate, here is a suggested setup:

#. The :file:`examples` and :file:`include` folders 
   should be sitting in some parent folder, 
   like :file:`comp170files`.  In this same parent folder create a new 
   sub-folder for your work.
   To be specific we will call it :file:`work`.

#. Copy from folder :file:`examples` to :file:`work`:
   
   * :file:`Generic.build` 
   * :file:`run.cmd` for Windows or :file:`run.sh` for a Mac  
   * Other scripts from the examples folder if you like
   * Copy the whole library folder :file:`intro_cs_lib` to be a subdirectory
     of :file:`work`.
   

#. Then write a program in :file:`work`, and test it with your run script 
   (run.cmd or run.sh).  And so on as you write more programs....
   As long as you use namespace IntroCS and have your work directory located
   as instructed, you can freely use the library classes
   like ``UI`` and ``UIF``.
   
       
Running Programs in Subdirectories of examples
----------------------------------------------

The examples folder contains only one-file, stand-alone programs (except that they can
use library classes).  We have chosen to have an individual subdirectory 
for each program that has more than one supporting file.  We are putting
a special run script in these folders, with different contents, but the same
effect for you:  If this directory is your current directory, you can use
the run script in the same way as the run script in the examples folder.
Do supply the base name (no .cs) of the program file containing ``Main``.  

The folders with names ending in "_stub" are the start of a project for you.  
When you are asked to copy to a folder without the "_stub", you can put the copied folder 
as another subfolder of the examples folder.  
Alternately, if you set up a work folder, as discussed
in the last section, you can put the copied folder as a subfolder of
your work folder.  The copied run script in the sub-folder should work in either place.

A Really Simple Example NAnt Script
------------------------------------

The remaining NAnt sections are *only here for the curious*, 
or if you are creating new multi-file projects of your own:

Now we get into the internal details of NAnt scripts.  

Let's begin by taking a look at an example NAnt build script, which we'll use to 
compile the Hello, World
program:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/hello+nant/hello.build
   :language: xml
   :linenos:

The basic structure of a *build* file is simple. 
We'll begin with a high-level explanation and then drill
into a bit more details. 
Then we'll look at a more advanced example toward the end of this section.

- Line 1 is the XML prologue. You need to make sure this line is present to 
  indicate that this document is encoded in XML version 1.0. Don't change it, 
  and don't spend too much time thinking about what it means. 
  You'll be seeing a lot more of XML in the future (beyond this class, that is).

- Line 2 is a required element of every *build* file. 
  It is used to provide the basic info about your project
  and what should be done to build it. 
  In this example, the name is "Hello World" and the default target to 
  build (when someone types nant at the command line) is "build". 
  What this means is that the target named build (in line 12) will be 
  the first thing that is processed when someone just types nant. 

- So Line 12 contains the "build" target, which uses the "csc" (compiler) task to 
  compile the hello.cs program. Line 6 contains a rule that will remove all of the 
  products that are built during compilation. 
  That is, it will remove hello.exe and the .mdb and .pdb files (if present), 
  which are used for symbolic debugging (another concept we discuss later).

Again, this is a quick explanation, and not all details have been presented. 
Before we go into all of those details, let's take a look at how we can *use* these files.

You are encouraged at this time to have downloaded all of the example programs. 
There should be a folder named ``examples/hello+nant``.

Building the Example with NAnt
------------------------------

The following transcript shows a user (gkt) running nant to compile the 
Hello, World program. In this session,
the file Hello.build is present in the same folder/directory as hello.cs.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/hello+nant/nant-build.txt
   :language: text

When nant is run, you can observe that the Hello.build file is being used to compile 
the program. That's because NAnt *tells you* so by indicating the Buildfile it is using. 
Even though we did not use Hello.build anywhere on the command line, 
NAnt decided to look for it by finding *any* filename that ends in .build.

Once NAnt locates the build file, it reads it to determine that there is a target, 
build, that needs to be executed. The line starting with ``[csc]`` indicates that 
the compiler is compiling 1 file (which we know is hello.cs, being the 
only .cs file in the folder) to hello.exe.

The most important thing to see in the output is the phrase, BUILD SUCCEEDED. 
This indicates that the program compiled successfully. 
If you don't see this message, it means that you need to go and correct the errors in
your program.

For completeness, we show the output of ls (dir on Windows) that clearly demonstrates 
that the resulting hello.exe file was created successfully. 
Because our compilation task is designed to create files needed for
symbolic debugging, you can see that hello.exe.mdb is also present.

Removing the Build Products
---------------------------

An important part of developing programs in the real world is to not keep anything 
around permanently that could be built again later. 
This might sound a bit ironic, considering that when you purchase a 
program for your computer, the only thing you get 
(unless it is free/open source software) is the executable files, not 
the source code. 

But there is another reason you want to build your programs from scratch. 
You would want to begin by removing the executable code just in case you made 
a change to your C# code that somehow causes it not to build properly.
When might such a situation occur? Oh, perhaps it would happen around the 
time you need to submit your program to your instructor. 
By removing all of the build products and recompiling everything to make 
sure it fully works, you can rest assured that your program is ready to be submitted.

The following shows how to invoke the clean target to remove all of the stuff 
that we could easily rebuild from our source code.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/hello+nant/nant-clean.txt
   :language: text

In this case, we typed "nant clean" instead of "nant", 
because the default target is "build" (when we just type "nant"). 
You can observe that the clean rule is being executed and there are 
two lines beginning with the word ``[delete]`` that delete the files that are present, 
hello.exe and hello.exe.mdb. 
NAnt is smart enough do its work even if the .exe files are not present. 
That is, the delete task should be thought of as "delete if present".

So that's all there is to NAnt, at least if you are building simple programs. 
For COMP 170, we provide a *generic* build script in the ``examples`` folder 
that you can use for just about all of your work, except
when you get to the more advanced class project, 
where you might need to add some code to the build 
target. Luckily, we have already gone through and done much of the work for you, 
but you may still find yourself needing to make modifications to our build files.
This file takes a parameter for the program file being built.

Here's our Generic.build file:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/Generic.build
   :language: xml
   :linenos:

How to build examples in the examples folder manually:

.. code-block:: none

   nant -D:program=birthday1

To clean any example you no longer want, do this:

.. code-block:: none

   nant -D:program=birthday1 clean

Again, the convenience scripts simplify this.
