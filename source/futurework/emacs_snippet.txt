	Proper Indentation and Emacs java-mode
	--------------------------------------
	
	With this exercise, we are now entering a phase where we must start
	paying a bit more attention to the basic *appearance* of our code. As
	programs become larger, they also can become harder to maintain (let
	alone understand) if they are not formatted according to some basic
	style guidelines.
	
	In any event, luckily for us, we have access to editors like Emacs and
	Gedit (in the Linux lab anyway) that support automatic source-code
	indenting. In Emacs, you can enable this support by using
	*java-mode*. At the time of writing, there is actually a *csharp-mode*
	but it is not yet a part of the standard Emacs distribution. For the
	most part, you can get by using *java-mode*, given that C# is very
	similar to Java in terms of its overall syntax. It doesn't understand
	keywords like ``namespace`` but otherwise seems to work in our
	testing.
	
	When in Emacs, you can enable Java mode in your buffer for
	``do_the_math.cs`` by typing Escape-x. The minibuffer (the space you see
	at the bottom of the screen where an ``M-x`` or similar prompt is
	shown) will wait for you to type the name of a command. Enter
	*java-mode* and you will be able to take advantage of the magical
	support in Emacs for automatic formatting of your source code. Your
	instructor will show you how to make effective use of it.  Two features
	are worthy of immediate notice:
	
	- The program becomes color-coded.  On of the most useful things
	  is that literal strings have a different color.  
	  Forgetting the final quote mark at the end of a literal string
	  ia=s a common
	  error that may not be associated with good error messages.
	  The color coding makes it very obvious that the editor sees the
	  string as being too long.
	  
	- Nice indentation is done with very little effort.  Pressing the
	  Enter key still takes you to the beginning of the next line,
	  but a single further press of the tab key 
	  generally indents to exactly where the line should start.
	
	If you are feeling a bit adventurous, you can download *csharp-mode*
	from the Emacs Wiki at
	http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSharpMode. All you need to do is save
	the Emacs Lisp file (a file with the .el suffix) anywhere in your home
	folder. Then you can use Emacs to load this file (Esc-x, then type
	*load-file*). You'll need to browse to the folder where you saved the
	*csharp-mode* code to complete the process. Then you ca type
	*csharp-mode* instead of *java-mode*.
	
	As this is a bit of an advanced topic, this explanation will have to
	suffice for now. We're hopeful that future versions of Emacs will
	include *csharp-mode* by default.
