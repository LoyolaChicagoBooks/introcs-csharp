.. warning::

   This chapter is very much in alpha/beta form and is being worked on by Dr. Thiruvathukal and his student, John O'Sullivan.
   There are many rough edges.
   If you are interested in developing for iOS or Android, Xamarin Studio allows you to write for these platforms using the C#
   language. By providing this preliminary text, the hope is that students wanting to do more advanced project work will have
   an option. An Android-specific version of this is also in the works.
