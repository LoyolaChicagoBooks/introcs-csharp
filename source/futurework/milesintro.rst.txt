================================= 

For a general introduction to programming and the context of C# in particular,
there is already a good free online source,

Rob Miles CSharp Yellow Book 2012.pdf (or the latest year).

*Read* Miles Chapter 1, being aware of the comment below:

The chapter makes some reference to Microsoft,
the original creator of C#, and its
Visual Studio software development environment, which works only on Windows machines,
and costs a lot if you are not a student.
The :ref:`lab-edit-compile-run` will introduce an alternative to the 
Microsoft environment: Xamarin Studio and Mono, which are free, 
open-source software projects that make C# available for multiple platforms:  
Windows, Mac, or Linux machines.  With a substantial fraction of students having their own
machine that does  *not* run Windows, this flexibility is important.
