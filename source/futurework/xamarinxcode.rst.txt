Xamarin vs. Xcode
=================
What's the differences? The only difference between Xamarin Studio and Xcode is they have a different 
interface and programming language, but the end result is all the same, you get a iOS application.

How to start a iOS application in Xamarin Studio.
--------------------------------------

File > New > Solution... Then, click the gray arrow to display the different iOS types
and then selection the type of application you would want to design. The description are 
same as before. 

- "Master-Detail Application" This template provides a starting point for a master-detail
	application. It provides a user interface configured with a navigation controller to
	display a list of items and also a split view on iPad.
	
- "OpenGL Game" The template provides a starting point for an OpenGL ES-based game. It
	provides a view into which you render your OpenGL ES scene, and a timer to allow you
	to animate the view.

- "Page-Based Application" This template provides starting point for a page-based 
	application that uses a page view controller.

- "Single View Application" This template provides a starting point for an application 
	that uses a single view. It provides a view controller that manages the view, and a storyboard
	or nib file that contains the view.

- "Tabbed Application" This template provides a starting point for an application that
	uses a tab bar. It provides a user interface configured with a tab bar controller, and
	view controller for the tab bar items.

- "Utility Application" This templates provides a starting point for a utility application
	that has a main view and an alternate view. For iPhone, it sets up an Info button to 
	flip the main view to the alternate view. For iPad, it sets up an Info bar button 
	that shows the alternate view in a popover.

- "Empty Application" This template provides a starting point for any application. 
	It provides just an application delegate and a window.
