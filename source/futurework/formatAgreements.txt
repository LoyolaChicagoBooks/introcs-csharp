Format agreements:

    code:

        nant file in one multi-file project per directory under examples/
        one-offs directly in examples/

        IntroCS namespace everywhere there might be a reference to another file

		public added to methods only once doing multiple files


    notes:

        Function/method?

        	Use function in discussion for the static things, and only mention

            static method initially as being often used as a synonym in C#,

            though we will generally use it in object-oriented situations,
            discussed later.  
            
            After get to classes, stick mostly to static method?      

        Use `` with C# names and code that is embedded in text 

		set of line-orient text that is unformatted and not Pymentized should be
		like:
		
			.. code-block:: none
	
				5.0/2.0; 

				14.0/4.0; 
			
			or from a file:
			
			.. literalinclude:: ../examples/hgignore.txt

			   :language: none
	
		
		:file:, :menuitem:, :kbd: consistently used.  

        index names consistent:  
            topic lower case, 
            method/class upper case
        
        Is our work "these notes" or "this text" or ??
