One Dimensional Arrays
============================ 

.. index::
   array; [ ] declaration
   
Basic Syntax
---------------

A string is an immutable sequence of characters.  Arrays provide more general sequences, 
with the same indexing notation, but with free choice of the type of the items in the
sequence, and the ability to change the elements in the sequence.

For example, if we want the type for an array with ``int`` elements, it is ``int[]``.
In general for any element type, the type for an array of the element type is

    **type**\ ``[]``

so ::

   int[] a;

declares ``a`` to refer to an array containing ``int`` elements.  You do *not*
know how many elements will be allowed in this array from this declaration.  
We must give further information to create the corresponding array object.  
A new object can be created using the ``new`` syntax.  An array must get a definite
length, which can be a literal integer or any integer expression.  For example ::

   int[] a;
   a = new int[4];
   
or combined with the declaration, ::

   int[] a = new int[4];

creates an array that holds 4 integers.  The elements of the array must get initial values.
Numerical arrays get initialized to all 0's with this syntax.

For a variety of reasons, including bookkeeping by the compiler, the actual data for
an array is *not* stored directly in the memory location allocated by the declaration.
The array could have any number of items, and hence the memory requirements are not known
at compile time.  Like all other object (as opposed to primitive) types,
what is actually stored at the memory location declared for ``a`` is a *reference* to the
actual place where the data for the array is stored.  
In actual compiler implementation this reference is an address in memory.
In diagrams we will illustrate object references with an arrow *pointing* to the actual 
location for the object's data.  For example after ``a`` is initialized:

.. image:: ../images/newArray1.png
   :alt: new array
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

The small box beside ``a`` is meant to indicate the memory space allocated when ``a`` is
declared.  As you can see that space does not actually contain the array, but only a 
*reference* to the array, pointing to the actual sequence of data for the array.
To make it easy to refer to the elements in the diagram, we also label the indices 
associated with each element, though they are not actual a part of what is stored in memory.

The general syntax to create a  new array is

   ``new`` **type**\ ``[`` *length* ``]``
   
After the type, there are square brackets enclosing an expression for the length
of the array - this length is unchangeable after creation.

.. index::
   single: [ ]; array indexing
   array; indexing [ ]
   index; array
   
The elements inside an array can to referenced with the same index notation used
earlier for strings. :: 

    a[2]
    
refers to the element at index 2 (third element because of 0 based indexing).

Unlike with strings, this element can not only be read, but also be assigned to::

    a[0] = 7;
    a[1] = 5;
    a[2] = 9;
    a[3] = 6;

These four assignment statements 
would replace the original 0 values for each element in the array.

This is a verbose way to specify all array values. An array with the
same final data could be created with the single declaration::

   int[] b = {7, 5, 9, 6};

.. image:: ../images/newArray2.png
   :alt: new array initialized with braces
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

The list in braces ONLY is allowed as an initialization of a variable
in a *declaration*, not in a later assignment statement.  
Technically it is an initializer, not an array literal.

Individual array elements can *both* be used in expressions, and be assigned to. 
Continuing with the
earlier example code::

    a[2] = 4*a[1] - a[3];

``a[2]`` now equals 4\*5 - 6 = 14.

Arrays, like strings, have a ``Length`` property::

    Console.WriteLine(b.Length); // prints 4

Just as we saw that using a variable for an index was useful with
strings, in practice array elements are almost always referred to with an index
variable.  A very common pattern is to deal with each element in sequence,
and the syntax is the same as for a string.  Print all elements of array ``b``::

    for (int i= 0; i < b.Length, i++) { 
       Console.WriteLine(b[i]); 
    }
    
You could also use ``while`` syntax.  The ``foreach`` syntax would be::

   foreach( int x in b) {
      Console.WriteLine(x);
   }

The ``int`` type for ``x`` matches the element type of the array ``b``.

The shorter ``foreach`` syntax is not as general as the ``for`` syntax.  
For example, to print only the first *3* elements of b::

   for(int i= 0; i < 3; i++) {
      Console.WriteLine(b[i]);
   }

but the ``foreach`` syntax would not work, since it must process *all* elements.

Also use the ``for`` syntax to assign new values to the array elements, 
rather than just use the values in expressions::

   for(int i= 0; i < b.Length; i++) {
      b[i] = 5*i;
   }
   
Now the array ``b`` of our earlier examples (of length 4) would contain 0, 5,
10, and 15.  

.. warning::
   There is no analog of *changing* the value of ``b[i]`` with a
   ``foreach`` loop.  To change values in an array, we must
   assign to each location in the array by *index*.
   A ``foreach`` loop only provides the *value* of each sequence element
   for us to read.

We have had the array indices so far be given by a single symbol, 
which is the most common case in practice, but in fact what appears
inside the square braces can be any ``int`` *expression*.
Like parentheses, square brackets *delimit*
the inside expression, which gets evaluated first, before the array value is
looked up.  Consider this csharp sequence:

..  code-block:: none

    csharp> int[] a = {5, 9, 15, -4};
    csharp> int i = 2;
    csharp> a[i];
    15

This should be clear.  Now think first, what should ``a[i+1]`` be?

...

..  code-block:: none

    csharp> a[i+1];
    -4

In steps:  ``a[i+1]`` is ``a[2+1]`` is ``a[3]`` is -4. Be careful,
``a[i+1]`` is *NOT* ``a[i] + 1`` (which would be 16). 


.. index:: array; as parameter
   example; PrintStrings

.. _printstrings:

The code above to print each element of an array performs a 
unified and possibly useful operation, so it would make sense to
encapsulate it into a function.  A function can take any type as a
parameter, so an array type is perfectly reasonable!  Above we
printed each element of an array of integers.  This time let's choose strings,
so the formal parameter is an array of strings:  ``string[]``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/string_array/string_array.cs
   :start-after: chunk PrintStrings
   :end-before: chunk
   :linenos:
   :dedent: 6

With this definition, the code fragment  ::

     string[] hamlet = {"To be", "or not", "to be!"};
     PrintStrings(hamlet);
     
would print:

..  code-block:: none

    To be
    or not
    to be!

Here we are just reading the data from the array parameter.  
We will see that there are more wrinkles to array parameters in :ref:`alias`.

.. index:: function; return array
   array; returned by method
  
An array type can also be
returned like any other type.  Examine the function definition:
  
.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/string_array/string_array.cs
   :start-after: chunk InputNStrings
   :end-before: chunk
   :dedent: 6

This code follows a standard pattern for functions returning an array:
  
* In order to return an array, we must *first create* a new array
  with the ``new`` syntax.  We must set the proper length (``n`` here).  
* And we are not done with one line of creation:  Since the array has 
  multiple parts, we need a loop to assign all the values.  We have a simple
  ``for`` loop to assign to each element in turn.
* Finally we must return the array that we created!

.. _sign-array-exercise:

Sign Array Exercise/Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complete the code for this function:

.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/sign_array1/sign_array1.cs
   :start-after: chunk
   :end-before: chunk
   :dedent: 3


and place it in a program with a main function that demonstrates it.

You can compare your solution with ours in
:repsrc:`sign_array1/sign_array1.cs`.

.. index::
   command line; parameter
   parameter; command line to Main
   Main; parameters

.. _command-line-param:

Parameters to Main
---------------------

The ``Main`` function may take an array of strings as parameter, as in example 
:repsrc:`print_param/print_param.cs`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/print_param/print_param.cs
   :start-after: chunk
   :end-before: chunk
   :dedent: 3


By convention, the formal parameter for ``Main`` is called ``args``, 
short for arguments.  

Compile and run the program from the command line.
Run it again with some things at the end of the line like:

..   code-block:: none

     mono print_param.exe hi there 123

This should print for you:

..  code-block:: none

    There are 3 command line parameters.
    hi
    there
    123

See what quoted strings do.  Use command line parameters (with the quotes)  
``"hi there" 123``.
This should print for you::

    There are 2 command line parameters.
    hi there
    123

.. index::
   Xamarin Studio; command line parameters
   command line; parameters in Xamarin Studio

You can simulate command line parameters inside Xamarin Studio:

#.  Open the local popup menu for the project you are using.
#.  Select Run With > 
#.  In the submenu select Custom Parameters.
#.  That brings up a dialog where you can enter the
    desired command line parameters.
#.  Optionally you can remember this setup by clicking on
    box in front of "Save this configuration as a custom execution mode".
    If you check it, you get a place to enter a Custom Mode Name.
#.  End up clicking the Execute button.
#.  If you set a Custom Mode, later when you get to the submenu after
    "Run With >", you will see your custom mode name to select!

Try it!

.. index:: Xamarin Studio; combined with command line execution
   command line; execution combined with Xamarin Studio editing
   
An alternative when you want to use command line parameters repeatedly is 

  #. Use Xamarin Studio for editing and compiling.
     To compile but not run, the command is **Build** rather than **Run**.
  #. Meanwhile keep a console/terminal 
     window open in the :file:`Debug` directory, and enter execution
     commands there, including the command line parameters 
     actually on the command line!
     Even if you have a long set of parameters, you can easily run your  
     program multiple times with the same parameters by just pressing 
     the up arrow key in the terminal when you see the next command line prompt, 
     taking you back to the previous command
     (or keep going back several commands).  This is also 
     convenient if you want to slightly edit the parameters: you can
     edit a line that you redisplay from your command history.
  #. Do not close this window until you are done with your session of executing
     from the command line.  By using the same terminal window, you also 
     save the history of all your runs.  You can scroll the window up
     to see past executions.
     
If one run leads you to go back and fix a bug, go back to step one to
build the program again, and continue executing in the same terminal window.

Modified Parameter Print Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify a copy of :repsrc:`print_param/print_param.cs` to contain the earlier
example function :ref:`PrintStrings <printstrings>`, and call it.

.. index:: exercise; command line adder
   command line adder exercise
   Main; parameter exercise
   parameter; for Main exercise

.. _command-line-adder-exercise:

Command Line Adder Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``adder.cs`` that calculates and prints the sum of 
command line parameters, so if you make the command line parameters
in Xamarin Studio be 

..  code-block:: none

    2 5 22

then the program prints 29.

Do try running from the command line:  If you compiled with
Xamarin Studio, that means going down to the bin/Debug directory.
Recall Xamarin Studio for Windows produces a Windows executable,
not a Mono file, so you can run
    
..  code-block:: none

    adder 2 5 22
    
but on a Mac you need to run with mono:

..  code-block:: none

    mono adder.exe 2 5 22

.. index:: string; Split
   Split method for strings
   
.. _Split:

String Method Split
---------------------

A string method producing an array:

``string[] Split(char`` **separator** ``)``   
    Returns an array of substrings from *this* string.  They are the pieces left
    after chopping out the separator character from the string. 
    A piece may be the empty string. 
    Example: 

    ..  code-block:: none
    
		csharp> var fruitString = "apple pear banana";
		csharp> string[] fruit = fruitString.Split(' ');
		csharp> fruit;
		{ "apple", "pear", "banana" }
		csharp> fruit[1];
		"pear"
		csharp> var s = "  extra   spaces ";
		csharp> s.Split(' ');
		{ "", "", "extra", "", "", "spaces", "" }
		
Note: The response with the list in braces is a purely *csharp* convention for displaying
sequences for the user.  There is no corresponding string displayed by C# Write commands.
Also see that the string is split at *each* ``separator``, 
even if that produces empty strings.

.. index:: IntsFromString1
   index; parallel arrays

.. _ints_from_string1:

``Split`` is useful for parsing a line with several parts.  You might get a group of 
integers on a line of text, for instance from::

         string input = UI.PromptLine(
            "Please enter some integers, separated by single spaces: ");

To extract the numbers, you want to the separate the entries in the string
with ``Split``, *and* you probably want further processing: 
If you want them as integers, not strings, you must convert each one separately.

It is useful to put this idea in a function.
See the type returned.  It is an array ``int[]`` for the int results::

      /// Return ints taken from space separated integers in a string.
      public static int[] IntsFromString1(string input)
      {
         string[] integers = input.Split(' ');
         int[] data = new int[integers.Length];
         for (int i=0; i < data.Length; i++)
            data[i] = int.Parse(integers[i]);
         return data;
      }
      
In a call to ``IntsFromString1("2 5 22")``,  ``integers`` would be 
an array containing strings ``"2"``, ``"5"``, and ``"22"``.  
We need the conversions to ``int`` to go in a new array that we call ``data``.
We must set its length, which will clearly be the same as for ``integers``,
``integers.Length``.
To assign elements into ``data`` we need a loop providing indices,
like the ``for`` loop provided.  Then for each index, we parse a
string in ``integers`` into an ``int``, 
and place the ``int`` in the corresponding location in ``data``.  We need to return
``data`` at the end to make it accessible to the caller.

Again we use the basic pattern for returning an array.  

Dealing with arrays is hard for many students for several reasons:

*  You have new array declaration and creation syntax.
*  Array are compound objects, so there is a lot to think about.
*  Loops are hard for many people, and you almost always deal with loops.
*  You usually must deal with index variables, and there are many 
   patterns.

The last point is significant, 
so it is important to note the special pattern in the example above:

.. note::
   The use of the same index variable for more than one array is 
   a standard way to have 
   *related* entries in *corresponding* positions in the arrays.

We will introduce a refinement of this function in the
:ref:`intsfromstring_exercise`.  It will rely on a more complicated
index-handling pattern.

.. _new_upper:

NewUpper Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complete the definition for

.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/string_array/string_array.cs
   :start-after: chunk NewUpper
   :end-before: {
   :dedent: 6


and write a ``Main`` driver to demonstrate it.  Use the example function
:ref:`PrintStrings <printstrings>` in your demonstration.

  
.. index:: alias

.. _alias:

References and Aliases
-------------------------

Object variables, like arrays, are references, 
and this has important implications for
assignment.

With a primitive type like an ``int``, an assignment copies the data:

.. image:: ../images/intCopy.png
   :alt: copying an int
   :align: center
   :width: 90 pt

In the diagram, the contents of the memory box labeled ``b`` is copied to the
memory box labeled ``d``. The value of ``d`` starts off equal to the value of ``b``, 
but can later be changed independently.

Contrast an assignment with arrays.  The value that is copied is the *reference*,
not the array data itself, so both end up pointing at the *same*  actual array:

.. image:: ../images/arrayAlias.png
   :alt: copying an array reference
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt
   
Hereafter, array assignments like::

   b[2] = -10;
   d[1] = 55;
   
would both change the *same* array.  Now ``b`` and ``d`` are essentially
names for the same thing (the actual array).  The technical term matches English:
The names are *aliases*.

This may seem like a pretty silly discussion.   Why bother to give two different 
names to the same object?  Isn't one enough?  In fact it is very important
in function/method calls.  An array reference can be passed as an actual value, 
and it is the array *reference* that is copied to the formal parameter, so
the formal parameter name is an **alias** for the actual parameter name.

.. note::
   If an array passed as a parameter to a method has elements changed in the
   method, then the change affects the actual parameter array.
   The change *remains* in the actual parameter array *after* 
   the method has terminated.

.. index:: example; Scale
   Scale example
   array; parameter

For example, consider the following function::

   // Modify a by multiplying all elements by multiplier. 
   static void Scale(int[] a, int multiplier)
   {
      for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; i++) {
         a[i] *= multiplier;  // or:  a[i] = a[i] * multiplier
      }
   }
   
The fragment::

   int[] nums = {2, 4, 1};
   Scale(nums, 5);
   
would *change* nums, so it ends up containing elements 10, 20, and 5.


.. _all_to_upper:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complete the function with this heading:

.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/string_array/string_array.cs
   :start-after: chunk AllToUpper

Write a ``Main`` method to demonstrate it.  Use the example function
:ref:`PrintStrings <printstrings>` to show off your result.


Sign Array II Exercise/Example

Create a variation on :ref:`sign-array-exercise` with a function 
with heading

.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/sign_array2/sign_array2.cs
   :start-after: chunk

and a main function to demonstrate it.

You can compare your solution with ours in
:repsrc:`sign_array2/sign_array2.cs`.

.. index::
   single: array; anonymous initialization

.. _Anonymous-Array-initialization:

Anonymous Array Initialization
--------------------------------

Sometimes you only want to use an array with specific values 
as a parameter to a function.  You could write something like ::

    int[] temp = {3, 1, 7};
    SomeFunc(temp);

but if ``temp`` is never going to be referenced again, you can 
do this without using a name::

    SomeFunc(new int[] {3, 1, 7});

Like with the use of ``var``, the compiler can infer the type of the array, and the
last example could be shortened to  ::

    SomeFunc(new[] {3, 1, 7});

It is essential to include the ``new int[]`` or ``new[]``
*in addition to*  the ``{3, 1, 7}``.

Such an approach could also be used if you want to return a fixed
length array, where you have values for each parts, as in::
    
    int minVal = ...
    int maxVal = ...
    // ...
    return new[] {minVal, maxVal};


Testing NewUpper Exercise/Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Elaborate :ref:`new_upper` so your ``Main`` method calls
``NewUpper`` with an anonymous array as part of the demonstration. 


You can see our code for all the string array exercises in example project
:repsrc:`string_array/string_array.cs`, and with the ``Main`` 
demonstration method in :repsrc:`string_array/string_array_demo.cs`.
    
.. index:: OOP; default value
   default value in instance 

.. _default-fields:
   
Default Initializations
-------------------------

Did you notice that when the first example array of integers was created,   
it was filled with zeros?  It is a safety feature of C# that the internal fields 
of objects always get a specific value, not random data.  Here are the defaults:

.. csv-table:: Default Values
    :header: "Type", "Value"
    :widths: 30, 10

    "primitive numeric types", "0"
    "bool", "false"
    "all object types", "null"

.. warning::

   An array with elements of object type, like ``string[]``,  
   without a specific initializer, 
   gets initialized to  all ``null`` values.  The creation is totally
   legal, but if you try to use the created value, like  ::
   
       string[] words = new string[10];
       Console.WriteLine(words[0].Length);  // run time error here 
    
   The error is because ``null`` is not an object - it does not have a ``Length``
   property.  If, for example, 
   you want an array of empty strings you would need to initialize it with
   a loop::
    
       string[] words = new string[10];
       for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++) {
          words[i] = "";
       }

Array Examples and Exercises
------------------------------

.. index:: index; variable not in loop heading
   example; remove_zeros.cs
   
We have been using array index variables all though this chapter.  
We have been getting you started in situations where
they all just advanced continually in a 
``for`` loop heading.  The fanciest situations have been where the same index
is used to reference more than one array in parallel.

Now that you have some experience, 
this section will include a variety of exercises where array index
variables need to be manipulated in fancier ways.  Consider this heading:

.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/remove_zeros/remove_zeros.cs
   :start-after: chunk
   :end-before: {

We have a starting array ``data`` and we need to create an ending array, 
but the corresponding nonzero data is *not*
at corresponding index values in ``data``!

Since we are returning a new array, we need to create it, and for that
we need a length.  How would you do that by hand?
Go through the original array, look at individual elements, and count the nonzero
ones.  We can do a counting loop Say we put our count into the variable 
``countNonZero``. Then create a new ``int`` array, say ``notzero``,  with the 
proper length.

The next part is new.  Clearly we need to get non-zero values from the original array 
``data`` and put them in the other array, ``notzero``.  
As we said, the array indices are 
not in sync.  That means we are going to need to deal with their indices
separately: The index in ``data`` is not going to relate directly to the 
index in ``notzero``.

We could just have a separate index variable for each array.  
Think about ``data``:
We do want to go through it sequentially, and we are only *reading* the
sequential values, so we can actually use a ``foreach`` loop and not
keep track of that index directly at all!  

On the other hand we need to assign values *into* ``notzero``, and hence we will
need to refer to an index variable for ``notzero``, 
say ``i``.

However, we cannot just assign the index values in a 
``for`` loop heading as we have been before! 
We have to be more careful and think when and how does ``i`` change?

This might be a good place to do this by hand, for instance with the sample
data in the function documentation.  Keep track of what ``i`` 
should be as you iterate through the elements of ``data``, one step at a time:  
How do you change
``i`` and when?  You are *encouraged* to stop and actually do this manually,
on paper, and think before going on....

You should see that:

*  We start by being ready to fill the place at index 0 in ``notzero``.
*  We only copy a non-zero element of ``data``, so we need an ``if`` 
   statement in the body again.
*  Each such non-zero number
   is placed after the last number we copied into ``notzero``.
*  This means that each time we copy an element to ``notzero`` we advance ``i``!

If you get those ideas together, hopefully you can write the needed code.  
Our version is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../source/examples/remove_zeros/remove_zeros.cs

Adding a ``Main`` demostration method, you get our full example
:repsrc:`remove_zeros/remove_zeros.cs`.

Initialization Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a.  In the ``NoZeros`` function above,
    what are the values in the array ``notzero`` just after
    line 12 is executed?

#.  In the :ref:`new_upper`  or our version of ``NewUpper`` in
    :repsrc:`string_array/string_array_demo.cs`
    consider the execution of the ``NewUpper`` function 
    immediately after you first create
    the string array that you are going to later return.  
    Right then, what are the element values in that array?


.. index:: exercise; ExtractItems
   ExtractItems exercise
   
ExtractItems Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A string intended to indicate a sequence of items could be like in the 
discussion  above of :ref:`IntsFromString1 <ints_from_string1>`.  
As illustrated there, individual items
are separated out neatly with ``Split``.  If you want to act on a user-generated
string, it is probably better to allow more leeway:  
Commas are often used to separate items or comma with blank, or several blanks.

In this exercise write a version that will accept all those variations
and return an array of non-empty strings, without the commas or blanks.
Complete this function::

   /// Return an array of non-empty strings that are separated
   /// in the original string by any combination of commas and blanks.
   /// Example:  ExtractItems("  extra  spaces,plus,  more, ") returns an
   /// array containing {"extra", "spaces", "plus", "more"} 
   public static string[] ExtractItems(string s)
   
Hints: It is possible to deal with more than one separator character, but
the simplest thing likely is to use string method ``Replace`` 
and just replace all the
commas by spaces.  If you then ``Split`` on each space you get all the non-empty
strings that you want *and* maybe a number of
empty strings.  You need to create a final array with just the nonempty
strings from the split.  When you create the array to be returned,
you need know its size.  Then populate it
with just the nonempty string pieces.
Handling the indices for the new array also adds complication.

.. _intsfromstring_exercise:

IntsFromString Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a function
``IntsFromString`` with a corresponding signature and intent
like :ref:`IntsFromString1 <ints_from_string1>`, but make it
more robust by allowing all the separator combinations of 
``ExtractItems`` from the last exercise, so
``IntsFromString(" 2, 33  4,55 6 77  ")`` returns an array containing ``int``
values 2, 33, 4, 55, 6, 77.  (Don't reinvent the wheel: call ``ExtractItems``.)
Also write a ``Main`` function so you can demonstrate the use of 
``IntsFromString``.
       
  
    
.. index:: exercise; TrimAll for arrays
   TrimAll exercise

.. _trim-all-exercise:
   
Trim All Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``trimmer.cs`` that includes and tests a 
function with heading::

   // Trim all elements of a and replace them in the array.
   //  Example: If a contains {" is  ", " it", "trimmed?   "}
   //  then after the function call the array contains
   //  {"is", "it", "trimmed?"}.   
   static void TrimAll(string[] a) 
   
   
.. index:: exercise; Dups
   Dups exercise for arrays

.. _Dups-exercise:
   
Count Duplicates Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``count_dups.cs`` that includes and tests a 
function with heading::

	// Return the number of duplicate pairs in an array a.  
	// Example: for elements 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 5 
	// the return value would be 4 (one pair of 2's three pairs of 5's. 
	public static int dups(int[] a)


.. index:: exercise; Mirror
   Mirror exercise for arrays

.. _Mirror-exercise:
   
Mirror Array Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``make_mirror.cs`` that includes and tests a 
function with heading::

	// Create a new array with the elements of a in the opposite order.
	// {"aA", "bB", "cC"} produces a new array {"cC", "bB", "aA"}
	public static string[] Mirror(string[] a)


.. index:: exercise; Reverse for arrays
   Reverse exercise for arrays

.. _Reverse-exercise:
   
Reverse Array Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``reverse_array.cs`` that includes and tests a 
function with heading::


	// Reverse the order of array elements
	// If array a first contains "aA", "bB", "cC",
	// than it ends up containing "cC", "bB", "aA".
	public static void Reverse(string[] a)

Do this *without* creating a second array.  (There is a
trick here.)
   
.. index:: exercise; Histogram
   Histogram exercise

.. _Histogram-exercise:
   
Histogram Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``make_histogram.cs`` that includes and tests a 
function with heading::

    // Return a histogram array counting repetitions of values
    // start through end in array a.  The count for value start+i
    // is at index i of the returned array, starting at i == 0.  
    // For example:
    // Histogram(new int[]{2, 0, 3, 5, 3, 5}, 2, 5) counts how
    // many times the numbers 2 through 5, inclusive, occur in
    // the original array, and returns a new array containing
    // {1, 2, 0, 2}, that is, 1 2, 2 3's, 0 4's, and 2 5's. The
    // count of 2's appears as the first (0th) element of the
    // returned array, the count of 3's as the second, etc.
    // Similarly, Histogram(new int[]{2, 0, 3, 5, 3, 5}, -1, 1)
    // returns the new array {0, 1, 0}, 
    // that is, 0 -1's, 1 0, and 0 1's.
    public static int[] Histogram(int[] a, int start, int end)

This problem clearly requires you to loop through all the elements of 
array ``a``.  You should *not* need any further nested loop.

.. _Histogram-interval-exercise:
   
Histogram Interval Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a slight elaboration of the previous problem, where
you count entries in intervals, not just of width 1. 

Write a program ``make_histogram2.cs`` that includes and tests a 
function with heading::

    // Return a histogram array counting repetitions of values
    // in array a in the n half-open intervals [start, start + width),
    // [start+width, start+2*width), ... [
    // [start + (n-1)*width, start + n*width) .  The counts for 
    // each of the n intervals, in order, goes in the returned array 
    // of length n.  For example
    // Histogram(new[]{89, 69, 100, 83, 99, 81}, 60, 10, 5)  
    // would return an array containing counts 1, 0, 3, 1, 1,
    // for 1 in sixties, 0 in seventies, 3 in eighties, 1 in nineties,
    // and 1 in range 100 through 109.
    public static int[] HistogramIntervals(int[] a, int start, 
                                           int width, int n)

The previous exercise version ``Histogram(a, start, end)`` 
would return the same
result as ``HistogramIntervals(a, start, 1, end-start+1)``.

Again, the only loop needed should be to process each element of ``a``.

.. index:: exercise; power table 2

.. _power_table_exercise2:

Power Table Exercise 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
Write a program :file:`power_table2.cs`` producing a table much 
like :ref:`power_table_exercise`, with right-justified columns,
but this time make each separate column have the minimum width
necessary - so there is a single space (and no less)
in front of some entry in
*each* column, except the first.  
Be careful: take the heading widths into account; the
parameter limits are important, too; test them::

   /// Print a table of powers of positive integers.  
   /// Assume 1 <= nMax <= 14, 1 <= powerMax <= 10 
   /// Example: output of PowerTable(4, 5)
   /// n^1 n^2 n^3 n^4  n^5 
   ///   1   1   1   1    1
   ///   2   4   8  16   32
   ///   3   9  27  81  243      
   ///   4  16  64 256 1024
   public static void PowerTable(int nMax, int powerMax)
