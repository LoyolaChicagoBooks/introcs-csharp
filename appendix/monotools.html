<h2>About Software Development Kits (SDKs)<a class="headerlink" href="#about-software-development-kits-sdks" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>A software development kit (SDK) is a set of tools for developing in a
particular programming language (in our class, C#). Developing in a
language means everything from compiling to running and (when things
go wrong) to debugging programs.</p>
<p>The Microsoft SDK is the proprietary implementation of .Net. It runs
only on Windows and is the primary development framework for all
things Microsoft.</p>
<p>The Mono Project SDK &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://mono-project.com">http://mono-project.com</a>&gt; is the free/open source
equivalent implementation of the Microsoft SDK.
It runs on all major platforms (including Windows) and is needed in situations
where you want to develop .Net applications on non-Windows platforms.</p>
<p>As an interesting aside, the company whose developers lead the work on
the Mono SDK are working on commercial tools that allow you to
develop/run applications written in .Net on Apple iOS and Android
mobile devices (phones and tablets).</p>
</section>
<section id="editing-and-building-tools">
<h2>Editing and Building Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#editing-and-building-tools" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Early programs were written with rudimentary text editors,
more primitive than Windows Notepad.  Gradually tools got better.
Now there are editors that are highly optimized for editing code.</p>
<p>After code is edited, it has to be converted into an executable program.
That may involve several files and libraries and other dependencies.
Streamlining and automating this process was a big deal.  There
are a variety of building tools that can be used with, or built into
an SDK:  make, ant, and now NAnt for .net.</p>
<p>Many developers use an a la carte approach, using their favorite editor along
with their favorite building tool.</p>
</section>
<section id="about-integrated-development-environments-ide">
<h2>About Integrated Development Environments (IDE)<a class="headerlink" href="#about-integrated-development-environments-ide" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are also all-in-one tools that combine an editor and build tools.
These are also used by many developers.</p>
<p>There are two major IDEs for .Net development, which we explain briefly below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Visual Studio is the Microsoft IDE that interfaces directly to the
Microsoft SDK.</p></li>
<li><p>Xamarin Studio is the free/open source IDE for developing applications
using the Mono SDK on Windows and all other platforms (in
particular, Linux and OS X).  The project started as MonoDevelop.
Now Xamarin is both a major contributor to the code and has commercial
versions for iOS development.  <em>The name on the software is now</em>
<strong>Xamarin Studio</strong>, though you may see references to MonoDevelop instead.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there is another Windows-specific IDE, SharpDevelop, that
inspired the creation of Xamarin Studio. It is still actively maintained
and provides a somewhat “lighter weight” alternative to Visual Studio
for Windows users. Like Xamarin Studio, it is aimed at developers who
would prefer a more free/open source “friendly” version.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-approach">
<h2>Our Approach<a class="headerlink" href="#our-approach" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In the interest of providing a consistent experience for our students who use
various operating systems on their own machines,
we will be using the multi-platform Mono (the SDK).</p>
<p>We find the IDE Xamarin Studio convenient to integrate everything for a beginner,
and it is a powerful tool at a more advanced level.  Hence we start off
introducing and using Xamarin Studio.  Later we will look at some of the
underlying tools that are obscured by the use of Xamarin Studio.</p>
<p>Mono has an extra advantage in the tool csharp, for immediate testing of
small snippets of code.  We will use it extensively as we introduce bits of
syntax.</p>
<p>As there is significant evolution of both the Microsoft
and Mono <em>toolchains</em>–a fancy word we want you to know and a more
elegant way of saying SDK–we’ll issue updates to this book.</p>
<p>Everything is free, but there are a number of steps.  Follow them carefully.</p>

<span id="install-mono"></span><span id="index-1"></span><h2>Installing Mono and Xamarin Studios<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-mono-and-xamarin-studios" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Because the Mono Project web page is known to change frequently, these
instructions are designed to be as generic as possible. If you have
any questions, you should contact the instructors immediately or seek
tutoring help.</p>
</section>
<section id="os-x">
<h2>OS X<a class="headerlink" href="#os-x" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Xamarin Studio needs at least version 10.8 of OSX.
If you have an older version, you can upgrade the operating system, or
possibly use an older version of Xamarin Studio.  In that case, ask for help.</p>
</div>
<p>There are two downloads to get and install in order. Mono first:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Go to &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://mono-project.com">http://mono-project.com</a>&gt;.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for the Mono downloads link. Link on OS-X.
You want to get the latest <em>stable</em>
version of Mono for OS X. For this class, you need version 2.10 or
later, though preferably 3.2.4 or later. Choose the MRE version.
It installs directly. Administrative privileges are required to run the
installer, so if you do not know this information, please stop
here.</p>
<p>Do <em>not</em> download Xamarin Studio from this site.
This version of Xamararin Studio bugs you with emails.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is how to do a quick sanity check of your Mono setup:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Go to Applications -&gt; Utilities and launch the Terminal
application, or quicker: enter terminal in Spotlight.
(Terminal is how you get to a command-line shell in OS X.)</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll see a prompt that looks like this
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">computername:folder</span> <span class="pre">user$</span></code>.
This means that Terminal is ready for input.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">csharp</span></code> and hit enter/return. You should see
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/bin/csharp</span></code> as output. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">csharp</span></code> is the C# interpreter.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">mcs</span></code> and hit enter/return. You should see
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/bin/mcs</span></code> as output.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mcs</span></code> is one of the interfaces to
the C# compiler.</p></li>

<li><p>Now go to <a class="reference external" href="http://monodevelop.com">http://monodevelop.com</a>.  <strong>Note</strong>:  Do <em>not</em> use a version

<li><p>As with Mono, we need to look for the downloads link.
You should download the <em>stable</em> version.</p></li>
<li><p>For OS X, the Xamarin Studio SDK is distributed as a DMG disk image. You’ll need
to download this image and double-click it. Open the image and run
the installer. Administrative privileges are required to run the
installer.</p></li>
<li><p>This time, you will see an App for Xamarin Studio,
which you can drag and drop into the Applications folder.</p></li>
<li><p>If the preceding steps were successful, you can launch
Xamarin Studio by double-clicking the icon in your Applications
folder. (You won’t know what to do with it yet, but at least you can
verify that it launches correctly and then use Command-Q to exit.)</p></li>

<section id="windows">
<h2>Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#windows" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are four packages, so this takes a while.  Mono first:</p>
<p>Dr. Yacobellis has a video showing Windows installation.
<a class="reference external" href="https://connect.luc.edu/p4hmzk2kbmt/">https://connect.luc.edu/p4hmzk2kbmt/</a>
There may be further changes to the system.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Go to &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://mono-project.com">http://mono-project.com</a>&gt;.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for the Mono downloads link. You want to get the latest
<em>stable</em> version of Mono for Windows. For this class, you need version
2.10 or later, preferably 3.2.3 or later.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the link: Mono for Windows, Gtk#, and XSP, and download the
installation package</p></li>
<li><p>It is a
self-extracting executable, so you will need to double click it to
install. For Windows 7 users, you may need to check your taskbar to
see whether the installer is being held up by Microsoft’s enhanced
security, UAM, that makes sure you really want to install something
you downloaded from the internet.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here is how to do a quick sanity check of your Mono setup:</p>
<section id="mono-command-prompt">
<span id="index-3"></span><span id="id2"></span><h3>Mono Command Prompt<a class="headerlink" href="#mono-command-prompt" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Open the Windows Start Menu and type “mono” in the text field at the bottom.
You should see a short list of places “mono” appears.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the choice that says “Mono … Command prompt”.
(This is probably faster than going to the Start Menu,
finding the Mono folder, expanding it, and clicking on
the Mono Command Prompt.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If it comes up, you are all set for an initial installation check. This will be the first
step later, when you want to run the handy csharp program or compile and run your
own programs.  When working, you can just leave this window open,
saving it for later use,
(or close and reopen later….)</p>

That should be at least numbered 4.2.2. <strong>Do not install it yet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note however, that you will next</strong>
<strong>install two support packages</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>.Net Framework 4.0 first.  The link takes you to a Microsoft download site.
Do not click the top Download button - that gives you much more than you need.
Further down in Popular download 01 is
Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Web Installer).  Click on that and follow
the default sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>GKT#  The GKT&#64; download directly downloads the GKT installer.  Again follow
the default installation sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>install Xamarin Studio <strong>last</strong>. The Download link gets you the installer
directly.  Install it following the default steps.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the preceding steps were successful, you can launch

<h2>Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#linux" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>We only provide instructions for Debian-based Linux distributions such
as Ubuntu.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Using the command-line <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apt-get</span></code> tool, you can install everything

<p>Xamarin Studio releases on Linux tend to lag behind the official stable
release.</p>
<p>This page,
<a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~keks9n/+archive/monodevelop-latest">https://launchpad.net/~keks9n/+archive/monodevelop-latest</a>,
describes
how to update your Xamarin Studio setup if it is not version 2.8 or later
as we’ll need for this course.</p>
<p>We wish to stress that Linux is recommended for students who already
have a bit of programming experience under their belts. It can take a
significant amount of energy to get a Linux setup up and running and
to tweak it to your liking. While it has gotten ever so much easier
since the 1990s when it first appeared, we encourage you to set it up
perhaps a bit later in the semester or consider running it using
virtualization software (on Mac or Windows) such as VirtualBox or
VMware.</p>
