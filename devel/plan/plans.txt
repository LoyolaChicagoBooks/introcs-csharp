        ?? .sln file generator
        more index: all .cs files referenced, all index entries, 
                    all syntax, all exercises  ?all warnings?
        music output?
        integrate CS examples better

        jEdit tool notes written in appendix

        eliminate Miles:
           *our* CS intro
           *our* intro example
           later file intro

        

    particular details:

        move csharp intro in notes before remainders.html (anh 2.4) (from lab-division 2.7.3)

        lab-division is repetitious on the details of the forms of division.  
        I prefer more concise reminders, and a reference back to the division section.

        homework-grade-calc refers to and executive summary, and then immediately has a
        section called details.  Those do not seem consistent.


Early brainstorming outline of possibilities:
        

A - Arithmetic Calculator

       / essential primitive types : mostly ref to Miles at this pont

       / essential conversions : mostly ref to Miles

  x    / random numbers using math rand? in guess lab - not double though 

        our approach: conversions is the only use of cast.





B - Strings   

      x  int.Parse(“100”)

      x  formatting output

      x  basics methods in string lab and intro

      X  more methods



C - Parameterless Functions   Done

      x  reading input in Main





D - Conditions

      x  read data in range

      x  min, max, 

      x   sign  exercise

E - Loops

     x  do-while, while, for, foreach

     x   testing/validating I/O

F - I/O Basics

        learing the basics of what a  REPL does

    x   prompt -> input -> parse -> validate -> action

        example in Miles, 3.1.4

        

    x   lab creating utility functions reading paragraphs, 

    x   canned (game) data into list and mapping

        towers of Hanoi

        maze search

        fill

        fractals

        almost all of these are in Lewis...





J - .Net Architecture
   X have limited intro

K - Unit Testing
   X have chapter




L - Tools
