This is quick documentation for Andy and Bob:

We now have a generic NAnt file for all one-off examples in this folder.

By way of example, to compile the birthday1.cs example to birthday1.exe,
do this:

nant -D:program=birthday1

To clean any example you no longer want, do this:

nant -D:program=birthday1 clean


At some point, we will allow build.dir to be specified. The current script
will place the build targets in the same directory as the sources, which 
is probably easiest for students.
