This is quick documentation for Andy and Bob:

How to build examples manually.

nant -D:program=birthday1

To clean any example you no longer want, do this:

nant -D:program=birthday1 clean

The resulting executable/debug data goes to the "bin" subdirectory

If on Linux/OS X, I have two convenience scripts. Someone can feel free to
create a .bat version for Windows.

sh build.sh birthday1
sh clean.sh birthday1
