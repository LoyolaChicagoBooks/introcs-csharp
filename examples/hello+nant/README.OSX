Update:
These notes no longer apply to OS X. It appears that Mono now ships with
a proper functioning NAnt installation.

If you run into problems, you can try the workaround here, but it should
no longer be necessary!


----
From George's earlier attempts on OS X:

To use NAnt on OS X to build the Hello, World example, you need to
set this environment variable:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/pkgconfig

Then you can run NAnt to build the program. Here is the output on 
my computer (named macaroni).
