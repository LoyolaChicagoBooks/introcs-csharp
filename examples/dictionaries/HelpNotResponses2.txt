Well, it never crashes on our system. 
It must have something to do with your system. 
Tell me more about your configuration.

I think this has to do with your hardware. 
Upgrading your processor should solve all 
performance problems. 
Have you got a problem with our software?

Are you running any other processes in the background?

But our software engineers are working very hard to fix them. 
Can you describe the problem a bit further?

Have you looked around and really compared our features?

The installation is really quite straight forward. 
We have tons of wizards that do all the work for you. 
Have you read the installation instructions?

memory
If you read the system requirements carefully, 
you will see that the specified memory requirements 
are 1.5 gigabytes.  You really should upgrade your memory. 
Anything else you want to know?

linux
We take Linux support very seriously. 
But there are some problems.
Most have to do with incompatible glibc versions. 
Can you be a bit more precise?
