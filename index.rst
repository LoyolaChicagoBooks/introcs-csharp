C# Notes for Comp 170
=====================

By Drs. Andrew N. Harrington and George K. Thiruvathukal
---------------------------------------------------------

You may use any of the C# Notes formats:

-   As web pages
	
    -  `Browse the notes online <CSharpHtml/index.html>`_. Html format flows to fit
       the width of your window.
    -  Download the `zip file to view locally <CSharpHtml.zip>`_: The web page to open after
       expanding the zip file is CSharpHtml/index.html.
	
-   `PDF file <ProgrammingInCSharp.pdf>`_ in fixed paged format for printing
    and for somewhat prettier computer viewing if your screen is wide enough.

In any case be sure to download the simple `examples zip file <examples.zip>`_ 
and the `monodevelop projects zip file <projects.zip>`_ then expand each to have
all the C# example programs and projects that go with the notes.

To quickly browse and download individual files in the examples and projects folders, go to:
   
   http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/src.
   
The change history is at
 
   http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/changesets

.. old
   For a quick look, you may also 
   browse the `example code online <examples-cs>`_ and the `project code online <projects>`_.

   The notes continue to be updated and expanded. You can see an outline of
   the latest major changes in the `change log <CSharpHtml/changelog.html>`_.  
   If you use a downloaded version, be sure to check for updates frequently.
   The PDF title page shows the date of the latest version.
