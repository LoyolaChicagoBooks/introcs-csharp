Downloading and Reading Options
==================================

Most readers will want to download the C# examples in ZIP format. More experienced readers (with 
previous background) may prefer using GitHub directly. (See below.)

We offer the book in HTML, PDF, and EPUB formats. Kindle users should use EPUB, which can be converted
to MOBI format. (We plan to offer it soon through our main site.)
