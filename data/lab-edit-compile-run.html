<p>This first lab is aimed at taking you through the end-to-end process of
writing and running a basic computer program with the Xamarin Studio
environment. As with all things in
life, we will learn in this lab that becoming a programmer requires you
to learn a number of other things along the way.</p>
<p>In software development/engineering parlance, we typically describe a
scenario as a <em>workflow</em>, which can be thought of as a series of steps
that are possibly repeated. The workflow of programming can loosely be
defined as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Use a text editor to write your source code (human readable).</p></li>
<li><p>Compile your code using the Software Development Kit (SDK) into
object code.</p></li>
<li><p>Link your object code to create an executable. (There are other
kinds of results to produce, but we will start with the idea of an
executable program to keep things simple.)  The default is to have
an executable program created with compilation, automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Run your program. Even for the most seasoned developers, your
program may not work entirely right the first time, so you may end
up repeating these steps (debugging).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These steps can all be done with different tools.  Many find it simpler to have
an integrated tool, like Xamarin Studio, that does them all in the same place,
and automates the steps that do not need human interaction!</p>
<p>If you are doing this on your own
machine, make sure you have Mono and Xamarin Studio installed as in
<a class="reference internal" href="../appendix/monotools.html#development-tools"><span class="std std-ref">Development Tools</span></a>.</p>
<p>Other tools are available, like
the development environment
Visual Studio (from Microsoft, focused on Windows).</p>
<p>Understanding the lower level tools that accomplish each step is important,
but we defer
a discussion to get you going with Xamarin Studio.</p>
<section id="goals">
<h2>Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#goals" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Our primary goal to create and understand an Xamarin Studio setup
that you can use to do all of
the remaining homework assignments and labs for this course.</p>
</section>
<section id="steps">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#steps" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Xamarin Studio files and interactions
are organized hierarchically.  At a low level are
individual C# source code files.  One, or possibly more, are used for a
particular <em>project</em>.  Multiple projects are gathered together under a single
<em>solution</em>.  Xamarin Studio deals with one solution at a time, though you can
separately create multiple solutions.  The simplest thing is to create
a <em>single solution for this course</em>,
and put each of the projects that you create in that one solution.
You can keep adding onto previous efforts without having to start over
with a new solution each time.</p>
<p>We start by creating a <em>solution</em> with a <em>project</em> in it.  The images are from
a Mac.  Windows versions should be similar.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Open Xamarin Studio, in the appropriate way for an application in your
operating system.  It should be in the Start menu for Windows.
Using Spotlight is quick on a Mac.</p></li>
<li><p>You get a Welcome screen.  Toward the upper left corner is a link for
New Solution.  Click on it.  Alternately you can follow the path through the menus:
File -&gt; New -&gt; Solution…</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/newSolution.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Welcome Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/newSolution.png" style="width: 150pt;" /></a>
<p>You should get a popup New Project Window, with a banner.
“Choose a template for your new project”.  It may initially show the
wrong template choice, like in the left column shown here:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/newProjectTemplateApp.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Project Template Image - App" class="align-center" src="../_images/newProjectTemplateApp.png" style="width: 110pt;" /></a>
<p>Make sure the template selection gets set to .NET (under Other) as in:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/newProjectTemplateNet.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Project Template Image - .NET" class="align-center" src="../_images/newProjectTemplateNet.png" style="width: 350pt;" /></a>
<p>The center part of the screen then shows further choices appropriate to
a .NET project.  Make sure <strong>Console Project</strong> is selected, and the language
shown in the highlighted line should be set to C#.</p>
<p>Then click Next.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The banner on the next form is “Configure your new project”. The
image shows the initial state for the author:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/configureProjectForm.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Dialog Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/configureProjectForm.png" style="width: 350pt;" /></a>
<p>Follow the order below to modify the form.
Later parts may not be visible until you do the previous parts.  The
image shows the final form as filled out by Dr. Harrington.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/configureCreate.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Dialog Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/configureCreate.png" style="width: 360pt;" /></a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Enter <strong>hello</strong> in the Project Name field, for the name of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to keep all your work together, we suggest that you
change the name of the solution from the copied “hello” and
enter any name you like:  We recommend <strong>work</strong>, which will make
sense for all your work for the course.</p></li>
<li><p>On <em>your</em> computer the Location field should start off showing a
Projects folder under <em>your</em> home folder,
(not the author’s home folder as in the image).  You can leave
it as is or change it if you like.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure <em>Create a project within the solution directory</em> is checked
in the box under the Location.</p></li>
<li><p>You may skip version control for now, though it is very handy.</p></li>
<li><p>After the three fields are filled in, the Create button in the lower right
should become active.  After checking your entires, click on Create.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You now have created a solution in Xamarin Studio, with one project
inside it. Later we can add further <em>projects</em> to <em>this solution</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look at the Xamarin Studio window that appears.  It should have two main sub-windows or
“Pads” as Xamarin Studio calls them.  A narrow one on the left is the Solution Pad,
containing a hierarchical view of the solution.  If you somehow close a pad,
you can recover it going to the main Xamarin menu: View =&gt; Pads =&gt; Solution.</p>
<p>In the Solution Pad you should see your solution name
at the top and the hello project under that.
Folders have a little triangle shown to their
left.  You can click on the triangle.  A triangle pointing down
means the inside of the folder is displayed.  A triangle pointing to the right
means the contents are not being displayed. Listed under hello are References,
Packages and
Properties, that we will ignore for now.  Below them is the line for the automatically
generated sample code file Program.cs.
The file should also appear in the Edit Pad to the right.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Program.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Program.cs Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/Program.png" style="width: 300pt;" /></a>
</li>
<li><p>Program.cs should be selected in the Solution Pad, as shown above.
Change the selection by clicking on hello.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The pictures show an icon at the right side of a selected project line
in the Solution pad.  This appears to have disappeared in the latest version.
To get the context sensitive popup window for such a line, you can right-click on
Windows or control-click on a Mac. Ignore later references to this now missing icon
and remember the new approach.
Other items in the Solution Pad will also have a context sensitive menu accessed by
right-clicjk or control-click.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bring up the context menu on the hello project in the Solution Pad.
Select Run Item.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/runMainMenu.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Run Program.cs Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/runMainMenu.png" style="width: 250pt;" /></a>
</li>
<li><p>Here Xamarin Studio combines several steps: saving the file,
compiling it into an executable program,
and starting running it if compilation succeeded.
With the canned file it should succeed!  You see a Console window
something like</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/pressKey.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Press Key to close Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/pressKey.png" style="width: 283.5pt;" /></a>
<p>Here you see the output of this simple program.
On Windows you can follow the instructions and press the space or Enter key.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This console window must be closed before you can run a program again.
If you go to run a program and the Run Item line is grayed out,
look for the unclosed terminal window you still have!</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>On Microsoft Windows, pressing spacebar or Enter kills the window.
<strong>On a Mac only, this makes the window gets two more lines, but still be visible:</strong></p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/processComplete.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Process Complete Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/processComplete.png" style="width: 198.75pt;" /></a>
<p>You have to actively close the Mac terminal window by clicking the
red window closing button, or using the keyboard, with Command-W.  You
can either do that now, or replace the previous spacebar/Enter
step with this action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This one time it is convenient to get the immediate practice of running
this automatically generated program
file, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Program.cs</span></code>.  Hereafter this file is an annoyance.
The file name and contents are always the same, and not useful.
You would need to redo the whole
code for your own program.  A general approach for all your projects
is to <em>delete</em> this
file and put in a file of your own:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure Program.cs is selected in the Solution Pad.
You save a step by closing the Edit Pad for Program.cs,
clicking on the X in the Program.cs tab at the top of the Edit Pad.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Solution Pad open the context sensitive menu for Program.cs, and select
Remove.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/menuRemoveMain.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Remove Program.cs Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/menuRemoveMain.png" style="width: 200pt;" /></a>
</li>
<li><p>You get another popup, with the <em>wrong</em> (rightmost) button selected,
Remove From Project.
Instead select the <em>left</em> button, <strong>Delete</strong>, as in
the image below.
Otherwise the file is left in the hello
folder, but it is just not listed as being in the project.
Each project is associated with a folder, but not everything
in the folder may be cataloged by Xamarin as part of the project.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/sureRemove.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Delete Program.cs Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/sureRemove.png" style="width: 360pt;" /></a>
</li>
<li><p>If you forgot to close the Edit Pad tab containing Program.cs earlier,
you can still do it – just say not to save changes to the file when asked.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>To get in code that you want, there are several approaches.  The one we take
now is to start from a completely
new empty file:  Pop up the context sensitive menu for the hello project.
Select the submenu Add…  and  then New File….</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/addNewFileMenu.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Add new file Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/addNewFileMenu.png" style="width: 340pt;" /></a>
</li>
<li><p>In the popup New File Dialog Window, it is likely that the wrong kind of file is
highlighted (likely Empty Class).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/makeEmptyFileDialog.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Add empty file Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/makeEmptyFileDialog.png" style="width: 350pt;" /></a>
<p>Click on <strong>Empty File</strong> instead.
Change the Name field from EmptyCSharpFile to hello.cs.
Always remember the “.cs”.
Click the New button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This should add hello.cs to the hello project and open an editing window for hello.cs.
The file should have no text.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/editEmptyHello.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio edit empty file Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/editEmptyHello.png" style="width: 180pt;" /></a>
<p>If it does have text, delete this file, too, and
go back to the previous step and be sure to select <strong>Empty File</strong>, not Empty Class.</p>
<p>Much like in most word processors type in (or paste)
the following code.  This is actually an equivalent
<em>Hello, World!</em> program to the automatically generated one,
but it is a bit shorter.
It only introduces the syntax we actually <em>need</em> at the beginning,
and will be discussing more shortly.  The automatically generate line numbers
are not a part of the text:</p>
<div class="highlight-csharp notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="linenos">1</span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="nn">System</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="linenos">2</span>
<span class="linenos">3</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Hello</span>
<span class="linenos">4</span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="linenos">5</span>   <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Main</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="linenos">6</span>   <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="linenos">7</span>      <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="linenos">8</span>   <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="linenos">9</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This program is deliberately simple, so you can type it into the text
editor quickly and become familiar with how
to create, edit, and save a program.  Here is how it looks pasted or typed
into the editor pad:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/pasteHello.png"><img alt="Xamarin Studio Edited new file Image" class="align-center" src="../_images/pasteHello.png" style="width: 230pt;" /></a>
</li>
<li><p>You can run the project just as before.  You should ge the same result, unless
you made a typing error.  In that case look for what does not match,
fix it, and try again.  Remember to close the
execution Console Window.</p></li>
<li><p>Now try a bit of editing:  Look at the program to see where output came
from.  Change what is printed and run it, but don’t eliminate the
output console
window for now (so you can show it off).</p></li>
<li><p>Now grab the instructor or teaching assistant so
they can perform a quick inspection of your work and check it off
(including the varied message printed).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Labs need to be completed to receive
credit. If you are unable to make class on a lab day, please make sure
that you complete the work and demonstrate it by the beginning of the
next lab.</p>
<p>At this point, you have accomplished the major objective for this
introductory lab: to create a Xamarin Studio project, and
enter, compile, and run a C# program.</p>
<section id="for-further-reinforcement">

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Can you make a new program variant print out two <em>separate</em> lines?
This is possible with an added statement.  It is also possible

and in the submenu select New project, and you go to the Project Template form.
It should remember your last settings, but do check:  Later we will
