Comments on Miles Chapter 1
============================ 

Miles Chapter 1 on Computers and Programs makes a good introduction and gives context.  
*Read* for the grounding it gives.

The chapter makes some reference to Microsoft,
the original creator of C#, and its
Visual Studio software development environment, which works only on Windows machines,
and costs a lot if you are not a student.
The :ref:`lab-edit-compile-run` will introduce an alternative to the 
Microsoft environment: Mono, which is free, 
open-source software that makes C# available for multiple platforms:  
Windows, Mac, or Linux machines.
