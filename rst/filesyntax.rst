File Syntax
============================ 

You already know how to use the ReadLine and WriteLine functions for Console.  
With a bit more setup you can use similar syntax for files.
Miles has a good basic introduction, page 71, section 3.6.  Read it.

Files are objects, like arrays, and use the ``new`` syntax to create a new one.
