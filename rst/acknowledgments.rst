Acknowledgments
==================

- The Sphinx team at http://sphinx.pocoo.org for creating such an awesome documentation
  tool
  
- The Bitbucket team at http://bitbucket.org for giving us a great place to collaborate.

- Jeremy Chalmer at http://jchalmer.com/ for his past work to get a *nice* Twitter Bootstrap
  theme working with Sphinx. We're now using the Sphinx Bootstrap Theme project at http://loose-bits.com/2013/04/10/sphinx-bootstrap-theme-bootswatch.html.
  
- Speaking of Sphinx Bootstrap Theme, I wish to thank the two developers (Ryan Roemer and Russell Sim) for adding support for some missing features, especially to support shorter navigation links, links to key pages (e.g. genindex). Their tireless dedication and friendly attitude are what makes free/open source software so awesome!
