|if-else| Statements
----------------------------

Run the example program, ``clothes.cs``. Try it at least twice, with
inputs 50 and then 80. As you can see, you get different results,
depending on the input. The main code of ``clothes.cs`` is:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/clothes.cs
   :start-after: chunk
   :end-before: chunk
   :linenos:

The lines labeled 2-7 are an |if-else| statement. Again it is
close to English, though you might say "otherwise" instead of
"else" (but else is shorter!). There are two indented statements
in braces:
One, like in the simple ``if`` statement, comes right after the
``if`` condition and is executed when the condition  is true. 
In the |if-else| form this is followed by an
``else`` (lined up under the ``if`` by convention), 
followed by another indented statement enclosed in braces that is only
executed when the original condition is *false*. In an |if-else|
statement exactly one of two possible parts in braces is executed.

A final line is also shown that is not indented, about getting exercise.
The `if` and `else` clauses each only embed a single statement
as option, so the last statement is not part of the |if-else|
statement.  Instead it is a part of the normal sequential
flow of statements.  It is *always* executed after the
|if-else| statement, no matter what happens inside the
|if-else| statement.  Again:  inside the |if-else| there is a
choice made, but the whole |if-else| construction is a single
larger statement, which exists in the normal sequential flow.
The compiler does not require the indentation of the if-true-statement
and the if-false-statement, but it is a standard style convention. 

The general C# |if-else| syntax is

    | ``if (`` *condition* ``) {``   
    |    statement(s) for if-true  
    | ``}``
    | ``else {``
    |    statement(s) for if-false 
    | ``}``


The statements chosen based on the condition 
can be any kind of statement.  This is the suggested form, but
as with the plain ``if`` statement, the if-true compound statement or 
the if-false compound statement can be replace by a single statement
without braces, except in one otherwise ambiguous situation discussed
later with two ``if``\ s and an ``else``.

.. index::
   double scope; compound statement

.. rubric:: More on Compound Statements and Scope

The section on local scope referred to function and method bodies,
which happen to be enclosed in braces, making a compound statement.
If fact braces limit the scope of things declared inside, 
*wherever* they appear.

As a result the following code makes no sense::

    static int BadScope(int x) 
    {
       if ( x < 100) {
          int val = x + 2;
       else {
          int val = x - 2:
       }
       return val;
    }

The |if-else| statement is legal, but useless, 
because whichever compound statement gets executed,
``val`` ceases being defined after the
closing brace of its compound statement, 
so the ``val`` in the return statement has
not been declared or given a value.  
If we want ``val`` be used inside the braces and 
to make sense past the end of the compound statement,
it cannot be declared inside the braces. Instead it must be
declared before the compound statements that are parts of the 
|if-else| statement.  The following would work::

    static int OkScope(int x) 
    {
       int val;
       if ( x < 100) {
          val = x + 2;
       else {
          val = x - 2:
       }
       return val;
    }
