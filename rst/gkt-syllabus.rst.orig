Professor of Computer Science
co-Director, Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities
Department of Computer Science
Lewis Towers, 531e

Contact Information
-------------------

E-mail is the prefered method of communication. Please use
gkt@cs.luc.edu for all communication.

Office hours are always provided on Tuesday and Thursday after class. If
you absolutely need to meet me and are finding things just a tad
crowded, you are encouraged to request an appointment. I give priority
to all appointments, even during walk-in hours.

Textbook
--------

The Yellow Book is the only *required* textbook for COMP 170. Lewis is a
*recommended* textbook and is only needed by those who benefit from more
of a "reading" based approach. You can use this book to supplement the
Yellow Book and our (hopefully complete) lectures.

Prerequisite
------------

Math 117 or Comp 163 or Comp 150 with a passing grade or better, or you
may be taking Comp 150 now. No prior programming experience is required.
We will do simple arithmetical calculations. The logical mindset of
mathematics is very useful, not a head full of formulas.

Overview
--------

The present page is basically administrative information. For course
content, see the page for the `Course
Introduction <notes/introduction.html>`_. If you already studied
introductory Object-Oriented Programming, and think you may not need
this course, see the `more complete summary of the top 10
topics <top10Things.html>`_, and consult with me.

Tentative Exam Schedule
-----------------------

We'll have quizzes every 3-4 weeks. To allow time for the project, there
will be no quizzes scheduled during the last 4 weeks of the course.
Schedule to follow.

The final exam slot will be used for your final project, which will be
graded as if it were your final.

Exam Strategy
-------------

For exams, people work at enormously different speeds. I hate to grade
people on pure speed. I want an exam short enough for everyone to do.
Rather than make it so short that each individual problem counts a great
deal, I have had success with making a reasonable length exam for most
people to do in a single class, but allowing people to stay an hour late
on exam days, in case you need extra time. If you cannot schedule either
time to be free on an exam day, let me> know as soon as possible. Try to
plan ahead for those three days.

On days when exams are scheduled, we will use the lab time to allow
extra time to complete the exam.

Class periods
-------------

I will not always be following the book. I will try to follow the topics
listed in this syllabus but in the end am more concerned about real
learning and fluency in computing as opposed to covering all topics.
Information and activities in class that are not in the book will be on
exams and used in homework. Your participation in class may help your
grade. I do not formally count class attendance, but I strongly
recommend that you be there to start your path in computer science well.

I will have
`notes <https://github.com/introcs-cs-luc-edu/introcs-lecture-notes>`_
from classes available on the web, but do not depend at all on their
completeness. Always check in with your partner or other classmate if
you miss class. I will generally have code examples on the web at my
`repository <https://github.com/introcs-cs-luc-edu/introcs-lecture-notes>`_.
My first priority is to run a good class for the people present.

I am very happy to give extensive help outside class to people who
attend class. If my first pass on an idea was not enough for you, we can
do better together in pass 2, and maybe pass 3 if needed, .... I am much
less enthusiastic explaining what has already happened in class to a
person who is frequently absent.

Cell Phones
~~~~~~~~~~~

I assume that my class is not the most important thing in your life.
Only you know the relative importance of any particular connection
through your cell phone, and whether it is important for you to answer a
call imediately rather than later. I do want you to be respectful of my
class and disrupt it as little as is practical. If you get cell phone
calls with fair frequency, be sure to have the ring muted (use vibrate
mode) before coming to class. If you rarely get calls, you might not
mute it ahead, and your cell phone may happen to ring. Get rid of the
noise as soon as possible, and do not get flustered. I assume you will
move outside the classroom for a conversation. If you get fairly
frequent calls that you are likely to consider important answering, sit
in a place where your exit and re-entrance are as unobtrusive as
possible.

Pair Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A recent paradigm shift in professional programming has been Pair
Programming, two people collaborating on one problem on one computer.
This has proven to be more efficient than each doing separate parts
independently and merging them, particularly when error fixing time is
included. More recently this approach has also been used in classes with
completely new student programmers. Not only have the individual
projects been done better with more confidence, but also students have
learned at least as well and had more enjoyment in the process. We are
encouraged to do pair programming in this course for labs and homework
assignments, and you are encouraged to work in pairs on your parts of
the final group project within overall teams of around 4 students. (Your
exams will NOT be in pairs however!) Read the page of `administrative
guideline s for pair programming <pair-programming.html>`_ and also the
page referenced there on `how to make pair programming
work <Kindergarten.html>`_.

Labs
~~~~

You are required to register for and participate in the laboratory
session for this class. The material covered in the lab sessions will be
an integral part of the course. In the lab you will gain hands on
experience with the concepts we discuss in class. The lab sessions will
be conducted by our teaching assistant who is a graduate student in
computer science. Your grade in the lab sessions will be based on
participation and on your final products. The grade will be one
component of your final grade in the course. Take advantage of the help
the TA's and I can give you in the lab! The TA's are Shruti Sudhindra
and Vasant Parvatagiri, with Loyola mail ID's ssudhindra and
vparvatagiri.


Programming Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be programming in C#--a language developed by Microsft as part
of the .Net framework. As this is a computer science course, however,
our goal is to make sure you can do your work on any reasonable desktop,
which includes Windows, OS X, or Linux. As such, we will be using an
implementation of C# from the `Mono Project <http://mono-project.com>`_
that supports the current C# language and is entirely compatible with
the concepts/materials we are covering in this class.

You are encouraged to download and install the Mono SDK (Software
Development Kit) for your computer/operating system right away
(version 2.10 or later, please). In addition, you will need to
download and install a text editor and the MonoDevelop development
environment, which will be used once we get experience with the basics
of editing, compiling, and running programs. Any text editor is fine
but we plan to introduce Vim and Emacs in a first laboratory exercise,
which are available on all platforms. We discourage the use of Windows
Notepad, which is not the best editor for programmers, owing to many
limitations.

Programming and homework assignments
------------------------------------

There will be approximately 4 pair programming assignments linked to the
course site. Most will extend over about a two-week period. The
assignments will be based on material discussed in class, assigned
reading material and lab work.

Homework is turned in using (still being determined but not Blackboard).
Assignments are due at midnight at the end of the date specified unless
otherwise stated. Assignments should be turned in on time, running
correctly. Please start early enough to get help if you need it, and get
the program working completely correctly before the due date. See the
next section for late assignment policies. You may only work with your
pair partner on the assignment, and NOT work with other students - see
the section below on `*Academic Dishonesty* <#Dishonesty>`_. Working on
programming problems is essential to your understanding of the course
material and will not only be a direct part of your final grade, but
will also affect your exam performance. There may be a second component
of programming assignments - reading another pair's submission
critically.

Late assignments
----------------

In this class the following lateness penalties apply to the individual
programming assignments: Assignments turned in up to one week late can
receive a 10% penalty. Assignments may not be accepted more than one
week late. If there is some special reason for an assigment being turned
in late, preferably speak to me directly first. I will consider reducing
the penalties. If I accept your reason, ALSO make a comment at the top
of your source code in the main program. (This reminder helps!)

Final Group Project
-------------------

You will also be assigned to groups of 3-5 for a large open-ended
project (writing a game and its instructions and other documentation),
that should be assigned after the second exam and should mostly consume
the last third of the course, in and out of class and lab. This will
provide quite a different experience from the more highly specified
individual assignments earlier in the course. Your group will be
expected to turn in an intermediate version part way through the
project, and you can use the feedback you get to make sure you are on a
successful track for a final submission. Each team will present their
game in part of the final exam period, and then we can all play other
teams' games! This is in lieu of a final exam.

At the end of the project, I will ask each team member individually to
turn in a form identifying the principal contributions of each member of
their group.

Extra help
----------

Learning is a spiral process, and different people need to take
different sized steps. Self dependence and stretching yourself are
great, but this only goes so far. Take advantage of the resourses
provided when you need them.

1. Please take advantage of the Pair Programming. You and your partner
   may complement each other very well.
2. I welcome questions inside class, in regular office hours, or by
   arrangement at other times.
3. When I am not available, please visit the Computer Science Department
   tutors. They have scheduled times all through much of the week. Also,
   you might try visiting several tutors: Some may fit you better than
   others. See the `tutoring
   schedule <http://www.cs.luc.edu/academics/services/tutoring>`_.
   Hopefully this is set up by the second week of classes.

Grading Breakdown/Weights

.. csv-table:: Grading Categories/Weights
   :header: "Category", "Quantity", "Weight"
   :widths: 15, 10, 30

   "Exams", 3, 40%
   "Labs", 15, 15%
   "Homework", 3, 15%
   "Final Project", 1, 20%
   "Participation", 1, 10%


The assignment/lab grade is a percentage of the maximum points possible.
The maximum excludes any extra credit options. Exams may be
scaled/curved. I convert the numerical grade from the final weighted
average to course letter grades with the following minimum requirements:


.. csv-table:: Grading Scale
   :header: "Grade", "Percentage"
   :widths: 15, 10

   "A", 93
   "A-", 90
   "B+", 87
   "B", 83 
   "B-", 80
   "C+", 77
   "C", 73
   "C-", 70
   "D+", 67
   "D", 60

It is my general policy to help students evaluate their options, if their
work at midterm is not at 70% or higher. Should you find yourself in the
position of falling short of this level, please make an appointment so we
can discuss your next steps.

If you have consistently displayed more knowledg, ability, and genuine
interest in class discussions than you show in your exams, I may raise
this grade. Note that one way to display your effort and thought is to
ask questions in class about your readings!

Exam Policy
-----------

Exam coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exams will cover material discussed in class, reading material in the
text and on the web, lab work, and assignments. Exams will always be
cumulative, but they will NOT include new material from the class
*immediately* before the exam. This way there will always be time for
questions after digesting a class.

Grading
~~~~~~~

Do not write down things on exams that you can see are incomplete or
incorrect without making some comment acknowledging this -- it is better
to know you are wrong than to be wrong and think you are right.

Missed Exams
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you must miss an exam, let me know well in advance. Then if you have
a good reason we can possibly make other arrangements. I have little
sympathy for people who inform me after the fact for no good reason. I
may completely excuse you from an exam if you were sick or unable to
attend for long enough. Most often if you cannot take an exam at the
usual time, I will want you to take it a little later, BUT I WILL NOT
LET ANYONE TAKE A LATE EXAM AFTER THE NEXT CLASS PERIOD. If you somehow
fail to let me know in a timely fashion that you have an excuse and want
to take the exam late, appear at my office before the NEXT class after
the exam, and I may be able to give you the exam.

No Do-Overs
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an excuse for not being prepared to take an exam, but decide
to take it anyway, you don't get to change your mind after you see a
poor grade. Being sick is not a way to get two chances. In certain
circumstances I may allow you to delay an exam due to illness, but I
will not let you be reexamined due to a poor grade.

As a reminder, I reserve the right to request documentation about
illnesses and "emergencies" that arise, especially in the case of
repeated absences.

Academic Dishonesty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The penalty for cheating may be anywhere from a 0 on an assignment to a
grade of "F" in this course. The appropriate dean will be informed in
writing of all cheating incidents.

Cheating consists of, but is not limited to:

-  Using or copying an outside person's work on an exam or assignment in
   any fashion.
-  Work includes outlines, pseudocode, code, documentation, and
   analyses.
-  Allowing your own work to be copied or used by an outside person.
-  Submitting as your own work something that has been written by an
   outside person.
-  Using any unauthorized reference on an exam or assignment
-  Using electronic communication (especially during exams) to gain an
   unfair advantage.

If you are working on a pair or group project, an "outside person" only
refers to people other than your assigned partner or team. Note that
cheating goes both ways: both giving and receiving.

Consultation is allowed with me, the TA, or official tutors for Comp
170. If you consult with any of these people, still make a comment at
the top of your work about the substance and depth of the help. Hiding
such help is also academic dishonesty.

Help from any source *is fine* concerning

-  The meaning of program specifications (not the plan for the solution
   or the actual solution).
-  The tools used to write programs. Feel free to ask questions on the
   programming environment you use and the use of the debugger.
-  The restrictions of C# syntax.

**Questions?** Please contact me if you have questions about these
groundrules or about anything else in the course. After class, by email,
in my office, by phone, all work for me. I am here to help.
