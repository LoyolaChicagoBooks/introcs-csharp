Examples With ``for`` Statements
==================================

Thus far all of our ``for`` loops have used a sequence of successive integers.
Suppose you want to print the first ``n`` multiples of ``k``, 
like the first 5 multiples
of 3:  3, 6, 9, 12, 15.  This could be handled by generating
a sequence ``i`` = 1 through ``n``, and multiply each ``i`` by ``k``::

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
       Console.WriteLine(i*k);
    }
    
Another approach is to note that the numbers you want to print advance
in a regular fashion, too, but with an increment 3 in the example above,
or k in general::

    for (int i = k; i <= n*k; i = i+k) {
       Console.WriteLine(i);
    }

The ::

   i = i + k;
   
is a common pattern, less common than incrementing by one, 
but still very common.  C# and many other languages allow a shorter version::

   i += k;
   
This means to increment the variable i by k.  

..  warning::
    
    Be careful: the ``+=`` must be in
    that order, with no space between.  Unfortunately the reverse order::

       i =+ k;
  
    is also legal, and just assigns the value of k to i.

.. index::
   operator; += -= *= /= %=
   single: += operator
   single: -= operator
   single: *= operator
   single: /= operator
   single: %= operator

Most C# binary operations have a similar variation.  For instance
if *op* is ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/`` or ``%``,

    **variable** *op*\ = *expression*
    
means the same as

    **variable** = **variable** op *expression*
    
For example ::

    x *= 5;
    
is the same as  ::

    x = x * 5;

Tables
----------

Reports commonly include tables, often with successive lines generated by 
a consistent formula.  As a simple first 
table, we can show the square, cube, and square root of numbers 1 through 10.  
The Math class has a function Sqrt, so we take the square root with Math.Sqrt
function.  The pattern is consistent, so we can loop easily::

   for ( int n = 1; n <= 10; n++) {
       Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2} {3}", n, n*n, n*n*n, Math.Sqrt(n));
   }

The numbers will be there, but the output is not pretty:

.. code-block:: none

    1 1 1 1
    2 4 8 1.4142135623731
    3 9 27 1.73205080756888
    4 16 64 2
    5 25 125 2.23606797749979
    6 36 216 2.44948974278318
    7 49 343 2.64575131106459
    8 64 512 2.82842712474619
    9 81 729 3
    10 100 1000 3.16227766016838


First we might not need all those digits in the square root approximations.
We can replace ``{3}`` by ``{3:F4}`` to just show 4 decimal places.

We can adjust the spacing to make nice
columns by using a further formatting option.  The longest entries are all
in the last row, where they take up, 2, 3, 4, and 6 columns (for 3.1623).
Change the format string::

   for ( int n = 1; n <= 10; n++) {
       Console.WriteLine("{0,2} {1,3} {2,4} {3,6:F4}", 
                          n, n*n, n*n*n, Math.Sqrt(n));
   }

and we generate the neater output:

.. code-block:: none

     1   1    1 1.0000
     2   4    8 1.4142
     3   9   27 1.7321
     4  16   64 2.0000
     5  25  125 2.2361
     6  36  216 2.4495
     7  49  343 2.6458
     8  64  512 2.8284
     9  81  729 3.0000
    10 100 1000 3.1623

We are using two new formatting forms:

   | ``{``\ index\ ``,``\ fieldWidth\ ``}``  and 
   | ``{``\ index\ ``,``\ fieldWidth\ ``:F``\ #\ ``}``   

where index, fieldWidth, and # are replaces by specific literal integers.
The new part with the comma (not colon) and fieldWidth, sets the *minimum*
number of columns used for the substituted string, padding with blanks as needed.

.. warning::
   There is a *special* language for the
   characters between the braces in a format string.  
   The rules are different than in regular C# code, where
   comma and colon are symbols, 
   and the parser allows *optional whitespace* around them.
   This is *not* the case inside the braces of a format string:
   There cannot be a space after the colon or before the comma.
   Some blanks are legal; some blanks lead to exceptions being thrown, 
   and other positions for blanks 
   just silently give the wrong format. 
   
   The safest approach for a programmer is just to have
   *no* blanks between the braces in a format string.

*If the string to be inserted is wider than the fieldWidth,* 
then the *whole* string is inserted, *ignoring* the fieldWidth.  Example::

    string s = "stuff";
    Console.WriteLine("123456789");
    Console.WriteLine("{0,9}\n{0,7}\n{0,5}\n{0,3}", s);
    
generates:

.. code-block:: none

    123456789
        stuff
      stuff
    stuff
    stuff

filling 9, 7, and then 5 columns, by padding with 4, 2, and 0 blanks.  
*The last line sticks out past the proposed 3-column fieldWidth.*

One more thing to add to our power table is a heading.  We might want:

.. code-block:: none

    n   square    cube    root
    
To make the data line up with the heading titles,
we can expand the columns, with code in example
:repsrc:`power_table/power_table.cs`:

.. literalinclude:: ../source/examples/power_table/power_table.cs
   :start-after: chunk
   :end-before: chunk

generating:

.. code-block:: none

     n  square    cube    root
     1       1       1  1.0000
     2       4       8  1.4142
     3       9      27  1.7321
     4      16      64  2.0000
     5      25     125  2.2361
     6      36     216  2.4495
     7      49     343  2.6458
     8      64     512  2.8284
     9      81     729  3.0000
    10     100    1000  3.1623

Note how we make sure the columns are consistent in the heading and further rows:  
We used a format string for the headings with the same field widths as
in the body of the table. A separate variation: We also reduced the length
of the format string by putting all the substitution expressions in braces
right beside each other, and generate the space between columns with a 
larger field width.

.. index:: left justification
   format; left justification
   justification; left
   
.. _left-justification:
   
**Left Justification:**  Though our examples have always right justified in
a field (padding on the left), for completeness we note this alternative:
A minus sign in front of the fieldWidth
places the result left justified (padded on the right).
For example::

    string s = "stuff";
    Console.WriteLine("1234567890");
    Console.WriteLine("{0,-9}|\n{0,-7}|\n{0,-5}|\n{0,-3}|", s);

prints:

.. code-block:: none

    1234567890
    stuff    |
    stuff  |
    stuff|
    stuff|

where the '|' appears after any blank padding in each line.

ASCII Codes
------------

Here is a reverse lookup from the 
:ref:`Numeric Code of String Characters <codeofstringchar>`:  
Find the characters for a list of numeric codes. Just as we can cast a
``char`` to an ``int``, we can cast an ``int`` 0-127 to a ``char``.

The Unicode used
by C# is an extension of the ASCII codes corresponding to the
characters on a US keyboard.  The codes were originally 
used to drive printers,
and the first 32 codes are non-printable instructions to the printer.
Characters 32 - 126 yield the 95 characters on a standard US keyboard.

A loop to print each code followed by a space and the corresponding 
printable character
would be::

   for (int i = 32; i < 127; i++) {
      Console.WriteLine("{0,3} {1}", i, (char)i);
   }

To make all the character line up we added a field width 3 for the code column.

If you run  this in csharp, 
the first line printed does not appear to have a character:  That is the
blank character.  All the other characters are visible.

Let us make a more concise table, putting 8 entries per line.
We can print successive parts using ``Write`` instead of ``WriteLine``,
but we still need to advance to the next line after every 8th
entry, for codes 39, 47, 55, ....
Since they are 8 apart, their remainder when divided by 8 is always
the same:  

    7 = 39 % 8 = 47 % 8 = 55 % 8 = ....

We can add a newline after each of these is printed.  This requires a test::

   for (int i = 32; i < 127; i++) {
      Console.Write("{0,3} {1}  ", i, (char)i);
      if (i % 8 == 7) {
         Console.WriteLine();
      }
   }

Recall that ``Console.WriteLine()`` 
with no parameters *only* advances to the next line.

Paste that whole code at once into csharp to see the result.

The next csharp> prompt appears right after ``126 ~``.  
There is no eighth entry on the last line, and hence no advance to the
next line.  A program printing this table should include an extra 
``Console.WriteLine()`` after the loop.

Modular Multiplication Table
------------------------------

We have introduced the remainder operator ``%`` and mentioned that the corresponding
mathematical term is "mod".  We can extend that to the idea of modular arithmetic 
systems.  For example, if we only look at remainders mod 7, we can just consider
numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  We can do multiplication and addition and take 
remainders mod 7 to get answers in the same range.  For example 3 * 5 mod 7 
is ``(3 * 5) % 7`` in C#, which is 1.  As we look more at this system, we will 
observe and explain more properties.

The next example is to make a table of multiplication, mod 7, and later generalize.

Tables generally have row and column labels.  We can aim for something like::

    * | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
    -----------------
    0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
    1 | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
    2 | 0 2 4 6 1 3 5 
    3 | 0 3 6 2 5 1 4 
    4 | 0 4 1 5 2 6 3 
    5 | 0 5 3 1 6 4 2 
    6 | 0 6 5 4 3 2 1 

The border labels make the table much more readable, but let us start simpler,
with just the modular multiplications::

    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
    0 2 4 6 1 3 5 
    0 3 6 2 5 1 4 
    0 4 1 5 2 6 3 
    0 5 3 1 6 4 2 
    0 6 5 4 3 2 1 

This is more complicated in some respects than our previous table, so start slow,
with some pseudocode.  We need a row for each number 0-6, and so a ``for`` loop
suggests itself::

    for (int r = 0; r < 7; r++) {
       print row
    }
    
Each individual row also involves a repeated pattern:  
calculate for the next number.  We can name the second number c for column.  The
next revision replaces "print row" by a loop:  a *nested* loop, inside the loop for
separate rows::

    for (int r = 0; r < 7; r++) {
       for (int c = 0; c < 7; c++) {
           print modular multiple on same line
       }
    }

and the modular multiplication is just regular multiplication followed by
taking the remainder mod 7, so you might come up with the C# code::

    for (int r = 0; r < 7; r++) {
       for (int c = 0; c < 7; c++) {
           int modProd = (r*c) % 7;
           Console.Write(modProd + " ");
       }
    }

You can test this in csharp, and see it is not quite right!  
Chopped-off output starts::

    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 2 4 6 1 3 5 0 3 6 2 5 1 4 0...
    
Though we want each entry in a row on the same line, we need to go down to the
next line at the end of each line!  Where do we put in the newline in the code?
A line is *all* the modular products by r, *followed* by *one* newline.  
Each modular product for a row is printed in the inner ``for`` loop.  We want to
advance *after* that, so the newline must be inserted *outside the inner loop*.  
On the other hand we do want it done for *each* row, so it must be 
*inside the outer loop*:

..  code-block:: csharp
    :linenos:

    for (int r = 0; r < 7; r++) {
       for (int c = 0; c < 7; c++) {
           int modProd = (r*c) % 7;
           Console.Write(modProd + " ");
       }
       Console.WriteLine();
    }
    
You can copy and test that code in csharp, and it works!

It is important to be able to play computer on nested loops and follow execution,
statement by statement.  Look more closely at the code above, 
noting the added line numbers.   
The basic pattern *is* sequential:  *Complete* one statement before going on to the next.
*Inside* the execution of a looping statement, there are extra rules, for testing and
looping through the whole body.  Within a loop body, each *complete*
statement is executed sequentially. 
 
Most new students can get successfully to line 4:

   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================
    line   r   c     modProd  comment
   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================
       1   0  \-          \-  initialize outer loop
       2   0   0          \-  initialize inner loop
       3   0   0           0
       4   0   0           0  Write 0
   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================

After reaching the bottom of the loop, where do you go?  
You finish the *innermost* enclosing statement.  
You are in the inner loop, so the next line is the *inner* loop heading
where you increment c and continue with the loop since 1 < 7.  This 
inner loop continues until you reach the bottom of the inner loop,
line 4, with c = 6, and return to the heading, line 2, and the test fails,
finishing the inner row loop:

   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================
    line   r   c     modProd  comment
   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================
       1   0  \-          \-  initialize outer loop
       2   0   0          \-  0 < 7, enter loop body
       3   0   0           0  (0*0)%7
       4   0   0           0  Write 0
       2   0   1          \-  c=0+1=1,  1 < 7: true
       3   0   1           0  (0*1)%7
       4   0   1           0  Write 0
       2   0   2          \-  c=1+1=2,  2 < 7: true
     ...                      ... through c = 6
       4   0   6           0  Write 0
       2   0   7          \-  c=+1=7,  7 < 7: false
   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================
   
At this point the inner loop statement, lines 2-4, has completed,
and you continue.  You go on to the next statement in the
same sequential chuck as the inner loop statement in lines 2-4:  
That sequential chunk is the the outer loop body, lines 2-6.
The next statement is line 6, advancing printing to the next line.
That is the last statement of the outer loop, so you
return to the heading of the outer loop and modify its loop 
variable r.  The two lines just described are:
   
   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================
    line   r   c     modProd  comment
   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================
       6   0  \-          \-  print a newline
       1   1  \-          \-  r=s0+1=1, 1 < 7 enter outer loop
   =====  ==  ==  ==========  =====================

Then you go all the way through the inner loop again, 
for all columns, with c going from 0 through 6, and exit at c=7, 
finish the body of the outer loop by advancing to a new print line,
and return to the outer loop heading, setting r = 2..., until
all rows are completed.

The common error here is to forget what loop is the innermost one 
that you are working on, and exit that loop before is is totally finished: 
It finishes when the test of the condition controlling the loop becomes false.

Look back one more time and make sure the code for this *simpler* table makes
sense before we continue to the one with labels....

The fancier table has a couple of extra rows at the top.  These two rows
are unlike the remaining rows in the body of the table, so they need special code.

If we go back to our pseudocode we could add to it::

    print heading row
    print dash-row
    for (int r = 0; r < 7; r++) {
       print body row
    }

First analyze the heading row:  Some parts are repetitive and
some are not: Print ``"* |"`` once, and then there is a repetitive pattern printing
0 - 6, which we can do with a simpler loop than in the table body::

      Console.Write("* | ");
      for ( int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
         Console.Write(i + " ");
      }
      Console.WriteLine();

The dashed line can be generated using ``StringOfReps`` from 
:ref:`lab-loops`.  How many dashes?  A digit and a space for each of
seven columns and for a row header, 
so we need
(7+1)*(1+1) characters, plus one for the '|':  1 + (7+1)*(1+1).  
Thinking ahead, we will leave that expression unsimplified.

We have done most of the work for the rows of the body of the table in the simpler
version.  We just 
have a bit of printing for the initial row label.
Where does the code go?  It is repeated for each row, soi it is inside
the outer loop, but it is just printed once per row, so it comes *before* the 
inner column loop.  The row label is r.  
The whole code is in example :repsrc:`mod7_table/mod7_table.cs` and below:


..  literalinclude:: ../source/examples/mod7_table/mod7_table.cs
    :start-after: chunk
    :end-before: chunk
      
Besides the 0 row and 0 column in the mod 7 table,
note that in each line the products are a permutation of all the numbers 1-6.  
That means it is
possible to define the *inverse* of the multiplication operation, and mod 7 arithmetic
actually forms a mathematical *field*.  
Modular arithmetic (with much larger moduli!) is extremely important in 
*public key cryptography*, which  
protects all your online financial transactions....  
Knowing a lot more math is useful! 
(But it is not required for this course.)

The inverse operation to multiplication for prime moduli is
easy to work out by brute force, going through the row of products.
A much more efficient
method is needed for cryptography:  That method involves
an elaboration of :ref:`gcd`.

Finally, let us generalize this table to mod n.  With n up to about 25, 
it is reasonable to print.
Most of the changes are just replacing 7 by n.  
There is a further complication
with column width, since the numbers can be more than one digit long.  
We can do formatting with a field width.  
Unfortunately in C# the field width must be a *literal*
integer embedded in the format string, 
but our number of digits in n is *variable*.

Here is a good trick:  Construct the format string inside the program.  
To get the format for a 
number and an extra space
mod 7, we want format string "{0,1} ", but for mod 11, we want "{0,2} ".  
This 1 or 2 is the number of characters in n as a string, 
given by  ::

   numberWidth = ("" + n).Length;

We can create the format string 
with a string concatenation expression::

   string colFormat = "{0," + numberWidth + "}";

or use
*another* format string and substitution.  This is an excuse to
illustrate including explicit braces (for the main format string).  
Recall the explicit braces are doubled.  Check out this version::

    string colFormat = string.Format("{{0,{0}}} ", numberWidth);

which we use in the code for the whole function, below, 
and in example program
:repsrc:`mod_mult_table/mod_mult_table.cs`.

..  literalinclude:: ../source/examples/mod_mult_table/mod_mult_table.cs

Head or Tails Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``heads_tails.cs``. It should include a function ``Flip()``,
that will just randomly print ``Heads`` or ``Tails`` *once*.
Accomplish this by choosing 0 or 1 arbitrarily with a random
number generator.  More details follow.
 
Use a ``Random`` object, as in :ref:`lab-number-game`, *except* this time it is 
important *not* to make the ``Random`` object be a local variable inside 
the ``Flip`` function:  A new ``Random`` object in likely 
initialized using the current time.  The ``Flip`` function has no interaction 
with the user,
so it can be repeated very quickly, and new ``Random`` objects
may not register a new value
through several reruns of ``Flip``.  This would give the same answer, 
and be completely contrary to the idea of random results!

Hence it is generally a good idea to only create a single ``Random`` object
that stays in scope for the whole program.
One way to do that is to make it *static*.  Place the declaration ::

  static Random r = new Random();

inside your class but outside of any function, positioned like 
the static constants discussed in :ref:`Static-Variables`.
  
Then you can use ``r`` in any function in your class.  
For ``int`` variables ``low`` and ``higher``, with ``low < higher``::
 
    int n = r.Next(low, higher);

returns a (pseudo) random ``int``, satisfying ``low <= n < higher``.
If you select ``low`` and ``higher`` as 0 and 2, 
so there are only two possible values for n,
then you can choose to print ``Heads`` or ``Tails`` with an
|if-else| statement based on the result.

.. warning::

   We have discovered some problems with the ``Next()`` implementation
   when running on Mono that sometimes results in random values not
   being generated. This is likely a bug that will be fixed. If you
   experience any problems with ``Next()``, the following is for you!

An alternative to generating random 0 and 1 values for heads and tails
is to generate random double-precision values. Using the same
variable, ``r``, you can call ``r.NextRandom()`` to get a random value
between 0 and 1. You can consider any generated value :math:`n < 0.5` to
be heads; :math:`n >= 0.5` represents tails::

    double n = r.NextDouble();
    if (n < 0.5) {
       // heads
    } else {
       // tails
    }
    
In your ``Main`` method have a ``for`` loop calling  ``Flip()``
10 times to test it, so you generate a random sequence of 
10 heads and/or tails.  With these 10 rapid calls, it is important
that a new Random object is only created once.  The suggested static
variable declaration ensures that.


.. index:: exercise; GroupFlips

Group Flips Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``format_flips.cs``. It should include the function ``Flip()``
and the ``static`` ``Random`` declaration 
from the last exercise.  Also include another function::
 
   /// Print out the results from the total number of random flips of a coin.
   /// Group them groupSize per line, each followed by a space.
   /// The last line may contain fewer than groupSize flips 
   /// if total is not a multiple of groupSize.  The last line
   /// should be followed by exactly one newline in all cases.
   /// For example, GroupFlips(10, 4) *could* produce:
   ///   Heads Heads Tails Heads 
   ///   Heads Tails Heads Tails
   ///   Tails Tails 
   static void GroupFlips(int total, int groupSize)

Complete this function definition and test 
with a variety of calls to ``GroupFlips`` in ``Main``.  
The output from the previous exercise would be produced by the call::

    GroupFlips(10, 1);
    
.. index:: exercise; reverse string
   reverse string exercise; 

.. _reverse-string-ex:
  
Reverse String Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``string_reverse.cs``. It should include a function with
description and heading::

    /// Return the reverse of s.
    /// For example Reverse("hello") returns "olleh".
    static string Reverse(string s)

    
In your ``Main`` method call Reverse several times to test.


.. index:: exercise; only letters
   only letters exercise; 

.. _only-letters-ex:
  
Only Letters Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program that defines and tests a function with
description and heading::

    /// Return s with all non-letters removed.
    /// For example OnlyLetters("Hello, World!") returns "HelloWorld".
    static string OnlyLetters(string s)

Assume the English alphabet.
    
.. index:: exercise; palindrome
   palindrome exercise; 

.. _palindrome-ex:
  
Palindrome Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program ``palindrome.cs`` that defines and tests a function with
description and heading::

    /// Return true when s is a palindrome.
    /// For example IsPalindrome("A Toyota!") returns true.
    static bool IsPalindrome(string s)
  
A palindrome is a string that contains the same sequence of letters,
ignoring capitalization, forward and backward.  Non-letters are ignored.
Examples are "Madam, I'm Adam." and "Able was I 'ere I saw Elba."

``IsPalindrome`` can be written very concisely by copying and using
functions from previous exercises.

.. index:: exercise; nested play computer

Nested Play Computer Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Predict what these code fragments print.  Then check yourself in csharp::

    for (int i = 3; i > 0; i--) {
        for (int j = i; j < 4; j++) {
            Console.Write(j);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
        
    string s = "abcdef";    
    for (int i = 1; i < s.Length; i += 2) {
        for (int k = 0; k < i; k++) {
            Console.Write(s[i]);
        }
    }
