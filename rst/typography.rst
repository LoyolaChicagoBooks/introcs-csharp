Syntax Template Typography
==============================


When new C# syntax is introduced, the usual approach will be to
give both specific examples and general templates. In general
templates for C# syntax the typeface indicates the the category
of each part:

===================  ===========================================
Typeface             Meaning
===================  ===========================================
``Typewriter font``  Text to be written *verbatim*
*Emphasized*         A place where you can use an arbitrary
                     expression. 
**Bold**             A place where you can use an arbitrary
                     identifier. 
Normal text          A description of what goes in that position,
                     without giving explicit syntax
===================  ===========================================

An attempt is made with the parts that are not verbatim to be
descriptive of the use expected.

We will use these conventions shortly in the discussion of function
syntax, and will continue to use the conventions throughout the
notes.
