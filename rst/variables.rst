Variables and Assignment
=========================

Each piece of data in a C# program has a *type*.  Several types have been introduced:
``int`` for integers, ``double`` for numbers allowing a fractional part,
approximating more general real numbers.  
There are many other numeric types and also non-numeric types, but we can use ``int`` 
and ``double`` for examples now.  Data gets stored in computer memory.  Specific 
locations in memory are associated with the type of data stored there 
and with a name to refer to it.

A program allocates a named storage spot for a particular type of data with a
*declaration statement*, like::

    int width;
    
Each declaration must specify a type for the data to be stored and give a name to
refer to it.  These names associated with a data storage location are called
*variables*.

The declaration statement above sets aside a location to store an ``int``, and names
the location ``width``.  Several variables of the same type can be 
listed together, like::

    double x, y, z;

identifying three storage locations for variables of type ``double``.

To be useful, data needs to be stored in these locations.  This is done with
an *assignment statement*.
For example::
 
    width = 5;

A simple schematic diagram with a name for a location in memory (the box):

Although we are used to reading left to right, an assignment statement works 
*right to left*.  The value on the right side of the equal sign is calculated 
and then placed in the memory location associated with the variable on the left
side of the equal sign, either giving an initial value or 
*overwriting* any previous value stored there.

.. image:: images/variableAssignment.png

.. index:: 
   double: initializer; =
   
Variables can also be initialized as they are declared::

   int width = 5;
   double x = 12.5, y = 27, z = 0.5;

or initializations and plain declarations can be mixed::

   int width = 5, height, area;
   height = 7;

Stylistically the example above is inconsistent, but it illustrates what is 
possible.  Technically an initialization is not an assignment.  We will see
some syntax that is legal in initializers, but not declarations.

We could continue with a further assignment statement::

   area = width * height;
   
Look at this in detail.  The assignment statement starts by evaluating the
expression on the right-hand side: ``width * height``.  When variables are
used in an expression, their current values are substituted, 
like in evaluating an expression in math, so the value is the same as

    5 * 7 
    
which finally evaluates to 35.  In the last step of the assignment statement,
the value 35 is then assigned to the variable on the left, ``area``.

.. warning::
   You want *one* spot in memory prepared for *each* variable.  This happens
   with declaration, not assignment:  Assignment just changes the value
   at the current location.  Do not *declare* the same variable more than once.
   You will get an error.  More on the fine points around that in :ref:`Local-Scope`.

.. index:: csharp

.. _more-csharp:
   
We continue introducing :ref:`csharp`:
Remember that in csharp you can just give an expression (and a semicolon),
and csharp responds with a value.  That syntax and reaction is special to 
csharp.   In csharp you can also test regular C# statements, 
like declarations and assignments.  As in a regular program, statements
do not give an immediate visible response in csharp.  Still in   
csharp you still can display a variable value easily:

.. code-block:: none

    csharp> int width = 5, height, area;
    csharp> height = 7;
    csharp> area = width * height;
    csharp> area;
    35
    
In the last line, ``area`` is an expression, and csharp will give back its value,
which is just the current value of the variable.

.. index:: 
   csharp; help
   csharp; quit;
   csharp; ShowVars

At this point you should be able to make sense of some more features of csharp.
You can start with the csharp special help command:

.. code-block:: none

    csharp> help;     
    "Static methods:
      Describe (object)       - Describes the object's type
      LoadPackage (package);  - Loads the given Package (like -pkg:FILE)
      LoadAssembly (assembly) - Loads the given assembly (like -r:ASSEMBLY)
      ShowVars ();            - Shows defined local variables.
      ShowUsing ();           - Show active using declarations.
      Prompt                  - The prompt used by the C# shell
      ContinuationPrompt      - The prompt for partial input
      Time(() -> { })         - Times the specified code
      print (obj)             - Shorthand for Console.WriteLine
      quit;                   - You'll never believe it - this quits the repl!
      help;                   - This help text
      TabAtStartCompletes - Whether tab will complete even on emtpy lines
    
A lot of this is still beyond us but these parts are useful:

.. code-block:: none

      ShowVars ();            - Shows defined local variables.
      quit;                   - You'll never believe it - this quits the repl!
      help;                   - This help text
    
We can continue the csharp session above and illustrate ShowVars():
    
.. code-block:: none

    csharp> ShowVars();
    int width = 5
    int height = 7
    int area = 35
     
displaying all the variables currently known to csharp, plus their current values.

We refer to "current values".  An important distinction between variables in math
and variables in C# is that C# values can *change*.  Follow this csharp sequence:

.. code-block:: none

    csharp> int n = 3;
    csharp> n;
    3
    csharp> n = 7;
    csharp> n;
    7
    
showing we can change the value of a variable.  The most *recent* assignment is remembered
(until the next assignment....)  We can imagine a schematic diagram:

.. image:: images/variableChange.png

We can carry this csharp session one step further,
illustrating a difference between C# and math:

.. code-block:: none

    csharp> n = n + 1;
    csharp> n;
    8

Clearly ``n = n + 1`` is not a true mathematical equation:  It *is* a C# assignment, 
executing with a 
specific sequence of steps.  

#.  First the right hand side expression
    is evaluated, ``n + 1``.  
#.  This involves looking up the current alue of ``n``, 
    which we set to 7, so the expression is the same as ``7 + 1`` which is 8.  
#.  *After* this evaluation, an assignment is made to the left hand variable, 
    which happens to be ``n`` again.
#.  Then the *new* value of ``n`` is 8, replacing the old 7.

There are many occasions in which such an operation will be useful.

Assignment syntax does have two strikes against it:

#. It appropriates math's equal sign to mean something quite different.
#.  The right to left operation is counter to the English reading direction.

Still this usage is common to many programming languages.  

..  warning::
    Remember in an assignent that the sides of the equal sign have totally 
    different meanings.  You assign to a variable on the left side *after*
    evaluating the expression on the right.
    
We can illustrate a likely mistake in csharp:

.. code-block:: none

    csharp> 3 = n;
    {interactive}(1,2): error CS0131: The left-hand side of an assignment 
    must be a variable, a property or an indexer

Students commonly try to assign left to right.  At least in this case you get
an error message so you see a mistake.  If you mean to assign the value of 
x to y, and write::
  
  x = y;
  
you get the opposite effect, changing x rather than y, with *no* error statement.  
Be careful!

There is some weirdness in csharp because it adds special syntax for expressions
that does not appear in regular programs, but it also wants to allow syntax
of regular programs.  Some conflict can occur when trying to display 
an expression, sometimes leading to csharp giving 
a strange error for apparently no reason.  In that case, 
try putting parentheses around the expression:

.. code-block:: none

    csharp> int width = 3;
    csharp> int height = 5;
    csharp> width * height;
    {interactive}(1,2): error CS0246: The type or namespace name `width' could 
    not be found. Are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?
    csharp> (width * height);

.. index:: literal, identifier

.. _Literals-and-Identifiers:

Literals and Identifiers
------------------------
   
Expressions like ``27`` or ``32.5`` or ``"hello"`` are called *literals*,
coming from the fact that they *literally* mean exactly what they
say. They are distinguished from variables, who value the compiler *cannot* infer
directly from the name alone.

The sequence of characters used to form a variable name (and names
for other C# entities later) is called an *identifier*. It
identifies a C# variable or other entity.

.. index:: keyword

There are some restrictions on the character sequence that make up
an identifier:


-  The characters must all be letters, digits, or underscores ``_``,
   and must start with a letter. In particular, punctuation and blanks
   are not allowed.

-  There are some words that are *keywords* for special use in
   C#. You may not use these words as your own identifiers. They
   are easy to recognize in editors like :ref:`jedit`, 
   that know about C# syntax:  They are colored differently.

We will only discuss a small fraction of the keywords in this course, but the curious
may look at the 
`full list <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x53a06bb.aspx>`_.
   
.. index:: case sensitive

C# is case sensitive: The identifiers ``last``, ``LAST``, and
``LaSt`` are all different. Be sure to be consistent. The compiler
can usually catch these errors, since it is the version used in the *one*
declaration that matters.


.. index::
   double: identifier; naming convention
   double: identifier; camel case
   double: naming convention; camel case
   double: identifier; multiple word
   double: identifier; underscores
   double: multiple word; underscores
   
What is legal is distinct from what is conventional or good
practice or recommended. Meaningful names for variables are
important for the humans who are looking at programs, understanding
them, and revising them. That sometimes means you would like to use
a name that is more than one word long, like ``price at opening``,
but blanks are illegal! One poor option is just leaving out the
blanks, like ``priceatopening``. Then it may be hard to figure out
where words split. Two practical options are

-  underscore separated: putting underscores (which are legal) in
   place of the blanks, like ``price_at_opening``.

-  using *camel-case*: omitting spaces and using all lowercase,
   except capitalizing all words after the first, like
   ``priceAtOpening``


Use the choice that fits your taste (or the taste or convention of
the people you are working with).  We will tend to use
camel-case for variable inside programs, while we use underscores in
program file names (since different operating systems deal with case
differently).
