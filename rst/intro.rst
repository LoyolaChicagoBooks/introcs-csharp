Resources Online
============================

This book is designed for Comp 170 at Loyola University, Chicago.  
The materials are available to all on the web.
Here are some important web links:

*   http://introcs.cs.luc.edu is the online text version for your web browser.

*   The 
    `course example file, source.zip <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/source.zip>`_
    is the *essential resource* to download and unzip onto your machine.
    Computer programs are designed to run on a computer and solve problems.  
    Though the initial problems will be tiny and often silly, 
    they will serve as learning tools to prepare for substantive problems.
    
*   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc5TVkj91XZhxRSJHsDoJzX5K1XKBAFLH
    is the growing YouTube playlist of videos based on book sections.   The numbers
    at the beginning of the titles are chapter and section numbers from the text.
    Older videos in an 800x600 pixel size that does not play well with YouTube are
    in box.com at https://luc.box.com/s/ggx0n1a0ijf8ctikxjo4/1/611829684.  The box.com 
    videos may either be streamed, including at full size, or they can be downloaded.
    The sequences on YouTube and Box
    interleave, using the same numbering system.

Except on very geometrically oriented topics, text-oriented learners may be 
happiest just reading the book.  For those who learn best with
spoken words combined with written words, the videos should be a good
start.  Even if you use a video for a section, you are encouraged to review
the written text afterward.  
Then be aware of the written version for quick reference.
The written text may include extra details and exercises, and it
will have the latest revisions.     

Her are further links that may be useful in our repository:

*   http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/
    is the home page for the repository of all the sources for the book.
    To read this book, you do not need to go to that URL, but if you do, the home page
    gives you an idea of what *updates have been made recently* to the book or 
    accompanying examples. Since improvements are made on an ongoing basis, 
    the notes about recent changes may be useful to you.
    
    The multiple production versions are generated largely by 
    `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ software from the common
    set of sources in the repository.  The sources are
    largely plain text files.
    
*   http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/src
    is the part of our repository containing the *latest versions*
    of the source code files.  
    You can quickly browse and view individual files in the examples folder.
    Example file links throughout this text refer to these repository files.
    
Alternate Notes Formats
-------------------------------------------   

You may use any of the C# Notes formats:

- `Web pages online <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/html/default/>`_ (Sphinx default theme) 
  or a version with the same content and 
  `a responsive web theme <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/html/bootstrap>`_ 
  (best for mobile devices).

- Download a
  `zip file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/html.zip>`_
  of the html web pages to unzip and browse *locally*.  
  Start your browser on the page index.html.	
  Or if you prefer, download
  `the version with a responsive theme <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/bootstrap/html.zip>`_.
  Unzip, open the index file, and all the pages are perfectly set up and linked.  
  However the *search capacity does not work* on a local copy, unless you have 
  a server going on your local machine....   
  In any case, you can still find things through the table of contents and the index links.
  
- `PDF file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/comp170.pdf>`_ 
  in fixed paged format for printing
  and for somewhat prettier computer viewing if your screen is wide enough.

- `eBook file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/comp170.epub>`_ 
  for offline reading on smartphones and tablets
  (or desktop computers running a soft reader application).
