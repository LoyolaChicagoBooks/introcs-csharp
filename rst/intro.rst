Resources Online
============================

This book is designed for Comp 170 at Loyola University, Chicago.  
The materials are available to all on the web.
Here are some important web links:

*   `The course example file, source.zip <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/source.zip>`_
    is the *essential resource* to download and unzip onto your machine.
    Computer programs are designed to run on a computer and solve problems.  
    Though the initial problems will be tiny and often silly, 
    they will serve as learning tools to prepare for substantive problems.
    
*   http://introcs.cs.luc.edu is an online text version for your web browser.  
    See also :ref:`alt-formats`.
    Except on very geometrically oriented topics, 
    *text-oriented learners may be happiest just reading the book*.  

*   https://luc.box.com/s/ggx0n1a0ijf8ctikxjo4/1/611829684 is a box.com
    folder containing all the videos.  
    The numbers
    at the beginning of the titles are chapter and section numbers from the text.
    The listing in box.com takes up several pages.
    These box.com videos may be 
    
    - streamed, including at full size (though generally after an initial delay),
    - downloaded individually or 
    - the whole gigabyte folder can be downloaded at once to play later on your machine.  
      (This is a choice on the menu under the page's Folder Options.)
      
    There is a mixture of new high-def videos and older
    lower resolution
    800x600 pixel videos.  See 00README.html in that folder
    for a description of the differences
    between the old videos and the latest update of the online book.
    
    Box does not let you stream videos automatically in a *playlist* sequence.
    Most of the videos for the beginning of the book are created more recently in
    high-definition, in a form that YouTube handles in both full or lower resolution in
    the *YouTube playlist*
    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc5TVkj91XZhxRSJHsDoJzX5K1XKBAFLH.
    The older videos' size does not play well on YouTube, so 
    *only the newer videos are in the playlist*.  
    This is a good place to play through at least *the first five chapters of the book*,
    plus some *isolated* later sections' videos. 
    *YouTube does not supply a direct way to download and save videos*, 
    so use the Box folder for that.
    
    For those who learn best with
    spoken words combined with written words, the videos should be a good
    start.  Even if you use a video for a section, you are encouraged to 
    *review the written text afterward*.  
    Then be aware of the written version for quick reference.
    The written text may include extra details and exercises, and it
    will have the latest revisions.     

In various formats, be aware of these helpful features:
    
    * We have picked out particularly important words, phrases, and symbols,
      and put them in our 
      `index <genindex.html>`_, which is accessible from each web page.
    * In a web version on our website, you can use the 
      `Search option <search.html?q=&check_keywords=yes&area=default>`_ to
      look for words, in general.  The location of the search link varies depending on
      theme being used, and can be hidden.  This does *not* work on a downloaded 
      local html copy.
    * We start with a brief table of contents for the whole book.  
      *In the web versions*
      you can get the most detailed table of contents for a single chapter by 
      clicking on a chapter title in the main table of contents or the current
      chapter title in the top banner on a regular content page.

Her are further links that may be useful in our repository:

*   http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/
    is the home page for the repository of all the sources for the book.
    To read this book, you do *not* need to go to that URL, but if you do, the home page
    gives you an idea of what *updates have been made recently* to the book or 
    accompanying examples. Since improvements are made on an ongoing basis, 
    the notes about recent changes may be useful to you.
    
    The multiple production versions are generated largely by 
    `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ software from the common
    set of sources in the repository.  The sources are
    largely plain text files.
    
*   http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/src
    is the part of our repository containing the *latest versions*
    of the source code files.  
    You can quickly browse and view individual files in the examples folder.
    Example file links throughout this text refer to these repository files.

Alternate Book Formats
-------------------------------------------   

You may use any of the **Introduction to Computer Science with C# and Mono** formats:

- `Web pages online <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/html/default/>`_ 
  (Sphinx default theme) 
  or a version with the same content and 
  `a responsive web theme <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/html/bootstrap>`_ 
  (best for mobile devices).

- Download a
  `zip file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/html.zip>`_
  of the html web pages to unzip and browse *locally*.  
  Start your browser on the page index.html.	
  Or if you prefer, download
  `the version with a responsive theme <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/bootstrap/html.zip>`_.
  Unzip, open the index file, and all the pages are perfectly set up and linked.  
  However the *search capacity does not work* on a local copy, unless you have 
  a server going on your local machine....   
  In any case, you can still find things through the table of contents and the index links.
  
- `PDF file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/comp170.pdf>`_ 
  in fixed paged format for printing
  and for somewhat prettier computer viewing if your screen is wide enough.

- `eBook file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/comp170.epub>`_ 
  for offline reading on smartphones and tablets
  (or desktop computers running a soft reader application).
