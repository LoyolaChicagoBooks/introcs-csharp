============================

These notes are designed for Comp 170 at Loyola University, Chicago.  
The materials are available to all on the web.
Here are some important web links:

*   http://introcs.cs.luc.edu is the online text version for your web browser.

*   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc5TVkj91XZhxRSJHsDoJzX5K1XKBAFLH
    is the growing YouTube playlist of videos based on book sections.   The numbers
    at the beginning of the titles are chapter and section numbers from the text.

*   The multiple production versions are generated largely by 
    `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ software from a common
    set of sources.  The sources are
    largely plain text files that we store at the repository
       
       http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/.
    
    To read this book, you do not need to go to that URL, but if you do, the home page
    gives you an idea of what *updates have been made recently* to the book or 
    accompanying examples. Since improvements are made on an ongoing basis, 
    the notes about recent changes may be useful to you.
    
*   Computer programs are designed to run on a computer and solve problems.  
    Though the initial problems will be tiny and often silly, 
    they will serve as learning tools to prepare for substantive problems.
    
    The *essential resource* to download and unzip onto your machine is the 
    
       `course example file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/source.zip>`_
    
*   To quickly browse and view individual files in the examples folder, go to
       
       http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/src.
    
    Example file links throughout this text refer to the repository's latest
    versions of particular files that you should
    also have in your downloaded examples.
    
Except on very geometrically oriented topics, text-oriented learners may be 
happiest just reading the book.  For those who learn best with
spoken words combined with written words, the videos should be a good
start.  Even if you use a video for a section, you are encouraged to review
the written text afterward.  
Then be aware of the written version for quick reference.
The written text may include extra details and exercises, and it
will have the latest revisions.
 
Alternate Notes Formats
-------------------------------------------   

You may use any of the C# Notes formats:

- `Web pages online <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/html/default/>`_ (Sphinx default theme) 
  or a version with the same content and 
  `a responsive web theme <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/html/bootstrap>`_ 
  (best for mobile devices).

- Download a
  `zip file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/comp170html.zip>`_
  of the html web pages to unzip and browse *locally*.  
  Start your browser on the page index.html.	
  Or if you prefer, download
  `the version with a responsive theme <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/bootstrap/comp170html.zip>`_.
  Unzip, open the index file, and all the pages are perfectly set up and linked.  
  However the *search capacity does not work* on a local copy, unless you have 
  a server going on your local machine....   
  In any case, you can still find things through the table of contents and the index links.
  
- `PDF file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/comp170.pdf>`_ 
  in fixed paged format for printing
  and for somewhat prettier computer viewing if your screen is wide enough.

- `eBook file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/latest/download/default/comp170.epub>`_ 
  for offline reading on smartphones and tablets
  (or desktop computers running a soft reader application).
