Introduction to the Notes
============================

These notes are designed for Comp 170.  In some places they refer to the initial parts of
Rob Miles' free online 
C# Yellow Book.  There are some issues with it:

- In the content we want to look at, here does not seem to be any difference between the
  2011 and 2012 version, *but* you need care in downloading and choosing the right one,
  apparently depending on your operating system.

- In many browsers on any operating system, it seems you cannot open either version
  by just a regular click on the link.  
  But if you right click and select Save File As...., 
  you can download the appropriate version.

- `Miles' 2012 version <http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/Rob%20Miles%20CSharp%20Yellow%20Book%202012.pdf>`_
  seems to work on a Mac, but not Windows.

- Windows users should download 
  `Miles' 2011 version <http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/Rob%20Miles%20CSharp%20Yellow%20Book%202011.pdf>`_.

Download Examples
-------------------------------------------

Computer programs are designed to run on a computer and solve problems.  
Though the initial problems will be tiny and often silly, they will serve as learning tools
to prepare for substantive problems.

The *essential resource* to download and unzip onto your machine is the 
`course example file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/download/comp170code.zip>`_.

To quickly browse and view individual files in the examples folder, go to:
   
   http://bitbucket.org/gkthiruvathukal/introcs-csharp/src.


Alternate Notes Formats
-------------------------------------------   

You may use any of the C# Notes formats:

- `Web pages online <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/html/default>`_ (Sphinx default theme) or a version with the
  same content and 
  `a responsive web theme <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/html/bootstrap>`_ (best for mobile devices).

- Download a
  `zip file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/download/default/comp170html.zip>`_
  of the html web pages to unzip and browse *locally*.  
  Start your browser on the page index.html.	
  Or if you prefer, download
  `the version with a responsive theme <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/download/bootstrap/comp170html.zip>`_.
  Unzip, open the index file, and all the pages are perfectly set up and linked.  
  However the *search capacity does not work*.  
  We have a workaround in that we will publish.  
  It requires having a server going on your local machine....   
  The index links will work in any case.

- `PDF file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/download/comp170.pdf>`_ in fixed paged format for printing
  and for somewhat prettier computer viewing if your screen is wide enough.

- `eBook file <http://introcs.cs.luc.edu/book/download/comp170.epub>`_ for offline reading on smartphones and tablets
  (or desktop computers running a soft reader application).
