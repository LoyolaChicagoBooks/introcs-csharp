Snippets Example
================
First we open the needed modules.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/gcd.fs
   :start-after: snip-imports
   :end-before: snip-exception

Then we declare the exception class.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/gcd.fs
   :start-after: snip-exception 
   :end-before: snip-gcd

Here is the main gcd code.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/gcd.fs
   :start-after: snip-gcdbegin
   :end-before: snip-gcdend
