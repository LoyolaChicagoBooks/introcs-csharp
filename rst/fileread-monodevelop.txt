   Setting the Working Directory and Command Line Arguments in Xamarin Studio
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   ..  warning::
   
      If you are using files with Xamarin Studio, note that the *default* directory to start from
      when running a program, is the subdirectory :file:`bin/Debug`.  
      We will keep data files in the 
      main project directory.  To avoid needing directory path names with test data, 
      you need to make sure the working directory matches the test data location.
      
   Before you run your program:
   
   -   Select in the menu :menuselection:`Run --> Run With --> Edit Custom Modes...`.
   -   This brings up the dialog window, Custom Execution Modes.  
      Click the :guilabel:`Add` button.
   -   This is one way to reach the dialog window, Execution Arguments.
      The first field is Arguments.  This lets you set command line arguments to 
      pass to the ``string[] args`` parameter in ``Main``. 
      If you want to be able to change the parameters to a new value each time you run,
      click on the check-box in the bottom left corner of the window, 
      "Always show the parameters...".
   -   Browse to select the working directory, like the project directory.
   -   Particularly if you want to add several settings, you can change the identifying 
      name at the bottom Custom Mode Name field to something more descriptive than
      Default (Custom).
   
   Later when running your program:
   
   -   Select in the menu :menuselection:`Run --> Run With`, and click on the name you chose
      to describe the custom way to run your program.
   
   You can add a text data file as a part of your project in your project directory by 
   :menuselection:`File --> New --> File`, bringing up the New File dialog.
   Select Misc on the left column 
   and then Empty Text File in the next column, and enter the file name.
   
   You can test all of this with the project ``Files/SumFile``.  There is a test file in the
   project directory :file:`numbers.txt`.  You could make a custom run mode using the
   command line parameter ``examples.txt`` and setting the working directory to the project
   directory :file:`SumFile`.  You might want to copy the project to your repository. open
   it in Xamarin Studio, add a new data file, and use that as a command line parameter.
