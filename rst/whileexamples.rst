Savings Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea here is to see how many years it will take a bank account to grow
to at least a given value, assuming a fixed annual interest.
Write a program ``savings.cs``.
Prompts the user for three numbers: an initial balance, the annual percentage
for interest as a decimal. like .04 for 4%, and the final balance desired.
Print the initial balance, and the balance each year until
the desired amount is reached. Round displayed amounts
to two decimal places, as usual.

The math:  The amount next year is the amount now times
(1 + interest fraction),
so if I have $500 now and the interest rate is .04,
I have $500*(1.04) = $520 after one year, and after two years I have,
$520*(1.04) = $540.80.
If I enter into the program a $500 starting balance, .04 interest rate and
a target of $550, the program prints::

   500.00
   520.00
   540.80
   563.42

Strange Sequence Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save the example program ``strange_seq_stub.cs`` as ``strange_seq.cs``,

There are three functions to complete.  Do one at a time and test.

``Jump``: First complete the definitions of function ``Jump``.  
For any integer ``n``, ``Jump(n)`` is ``n/2`` if ``n`` is even, 
and ``3*n+1`` if ``n`` is odd.
In the ``Jump`` function definition use an |if-else|
statement.  Hint [#oddeven]_

``PrintStrangeSequence``: 
You can start with one number, say n = 3, and *keep* applying the
``Jump`` function to the *last* number given, 
and see how the numbers jump around!  ::

	Jump(3) = 3*3+1 = 10; Jump(10) = 10/2 = 5;
	Jump(5) = 3*5+1 = 16; Jump(16) = 16/2 = 8;
	Jump(8) = 8/2  =   4; Jump(4) =   4/2 = 2;
	Jump(2) = 2/2  =   1

This process of repeatedly applying the same function to the most recent result
is called function *iteration*.  In this case you see that iterating the
``Jump`` function, starting from n=3, eventually reaches the value 1.

It is an *open research question* whether iterating the Jump function
from an integer ``n`` will eventually reach 1,
for *every* starting integer ``n`` greater than 1.
Researchers have only found examples of ``n`` where it is true.
Still, no general argument has been made to apply to the
*infinite* number of possible starting integers.

In the PrintStrangeSequence you iterate the ``Jump`` function 
starting from parameter value ``n``, until the result is 1.

``CountStrangeSequence``:  Iterate the ``Jump`` function as in 
``PrintStrangeSequence``.  Instead of printing each number in the sequence,
just count them, and return the count.

.. later - sequence of counts?
    After you have finished and saved ``jump_seq.cs`` copy it and save
	the file as ``jump_seq_lengths.cs``.

	First modify the main method so it prompts the user
	for a value of n, and then prints just the length of the iterative sequence
	from listJumps(n).  Hint [#]_

	Then elaborate the program so it prompts the user for two integers:
	a lowest starting value of n
	and a highest starting value of n.
	For all integers n in the range from the lowest start through
	the highest start, including the highest,
	print a sentence giving the starting value of n
	and the length of the list from ``listJumps(n)``.  An example run::

		Enter lowest start: 3
		Enter highest start: 6
		Starting from 3, Jump sequence length 8.
		Starting from 4, Jump sequence length 3.
		Starting from 5, Jump sequence length 6.
		Starting from 6, Jump sequence length 9.
	

.. [#oddeven]
   If you divide an even number by 2, what is the remainder?  Use this idea
   in your ``if`` condition.
